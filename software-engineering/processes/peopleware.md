### Quality and productivity

* it's one thing to know that people worries > technical worries, but it's another thing to act in accordance with that idea

* overtime doesn't really exist, since for every hour of overtime, you have ~1 hr of undertime as well

* once one realizes they sacrificed a more important value (family, love, home, youth) for a less important one (work), they're devastated and seek revenge
  - don't let people be workaholics

* you need to take turnover into account whenever you set out to attain higher productivity
  - so you don't lose key people

* people under time pressure don’t work better–they just work faster.

* _flight from excellence_: allowing the quality standard to be set by the buyer, rather than the builder
  - quality, beyond that required by the end user, is a means to higher productivity

* power of veto: some Japanese companies let the team veto not-yet-ready products for release

* projects w/o deadlines outperformed those with

### Office environment

* easy non-solutions are often more attractive than hard solutions

* the typical project stuck in backlog barely has enough benefit to justify building it

* a good amount of space/worker ~78-100sq. ft.

> Anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that is superior to not measuring it at all.

* Thirty percent of the time, people are noise sensitive, and the rest of the time, they are noise generators.
  - 30% of people are inconvenienced

* if people log uninterrupted hours, they're more likely to be cognizant of allowing others to work uninterrupted

* if things are becoming an obstacle to getting work done, you need to make it known; others may also share the obstacle

* natural or organic order emerges when there is perfect balance between the needs of the individual parts of the environment, and the needs of the whole

### The right people

* the need for uniformity is a sign of insecurity on the part of management
  - the term unprofessional is often used to characterize surprising and threatening behavior

* in companies with high turnover, people tend toward a destructively short-term viewpoint, because they know they just aren’t going to be there very long

* late promotion is a sign of health

* an _expense_: money that gets used up

* an _investment_: the use of an asset to purchase another asset


### Culture

> Can-do thinking often replaces risk management when the outcome has been defined as a challenge

> “This work is so important that we must have it done by January first.” What they really mean is, “This work is so unimportant that we don’t want to fund it beyond January first.”

* constructive reintroduction of small amounts of disorder in the forms of: pilot projects, war games, brainstorming, provocative training experiences, rtaining, trips, conferences, celebrations, retreats
