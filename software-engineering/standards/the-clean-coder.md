# The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers

## Ch 1: Professionalism

* it's irresponsible to ship w/o testing; it's not aboiut saving face; it's about avoiding trouble for your clients and team by shipping responsibly
* you need to have 100% test coverage because you only write code that you expect to get executed, and thus you need to know that it works
* always check in code cleaner than when you checked it out

> You should plan on working 60 hours per weekâ€¦ 40 for your employer, and 20 for you (reading, practicing, learning, and otherwise enhancing your career)

* doing your daily job is performance, not practice
* you need to know enough about the domain to recognize & challenge specification errors

## Ch 2: Saying no

* your manager is counting on you to defend your objectives as aggresively as they defend theirs. That's how you two will get the best possible outcome

## Ch 11: Pressure

* professional developers are calm under pressure, knowing that their training and disciplines will save them
