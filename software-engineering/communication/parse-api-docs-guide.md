# Parse's Guide to Designing Great API Docs

Notes taken while reading [Parse's Guide to Designing Great API Docs](http://blog.parse.com/learn/engineering/designing-great-api-docs/).

### Documentation components

1. a reference
  * listing of all functionality in excruciating detail
    - all datatype & function specs

2. guides
  * a middle ground between the reference & tutorials
    - like a reference, w/ prose explaining how to use your API

3. tutorials
  * teaching users specific things they can do with your API
  * bonus points for including working sample code

### Tips

* include a gentle quickstart
  - minimal steps needed to do the smallest possible things with your API

* use multiple languages

* you can never over-communicate edge cases
  - include every edge case & every assumption made, either implicitly or explicitly

* show sample applications
