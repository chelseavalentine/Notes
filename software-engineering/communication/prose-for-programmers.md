# Prose for Programmers

Notes taken on [_Prose for Programmers_](https://github.com/joshuacc/prose-for-programmers).

* ask yourself what the goal and purpose of a document you're writing is, just as you'd want to know the requirements before building something
  - if it's an "I"/"me" response, then perhaps you haven't found the real purpose
  - should be focused on what the audience receives
  - "5 whys"
  - choose the structure(s) based on the goal and audience

* determine who will read the document, and figure out which are primary, and what their relations to the subject are

* create an outline (hierarchical list of things to communicate, and the approaches that'll be used)
