# Notes

This repository acts as my personal reference for the different languages, libraries, frameworks, and software that I learn.

## Back burner

It's impossible to have time to learn everything as I discover it, so I'll put them on the back burner for now.

### Web

##### Frameworks

1. Karma *(a JavaScript test runner)*
2. Bower *(a library manager)*
3. RequireJS *(use one JS import rather than many, by making your other JS files dependencies of your main one)*

##### Software

1. JetBrains' WebStorm *(will create a lot of boilerplates for you and integrate frameworks)*
