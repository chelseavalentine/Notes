##### If statements
```Java
//You could just have a one-way if statement
if (CONDITION == IS MET) {
  [execute this code];
}

//Or you could do a two-way if statement like this (if-else)
if (CONDITION == IS MET) {
  [execute that code];
}
else{
  [execute that code];
}

//And you could even do a multi-way if-else statement like this
if (CONDITION == IS MET){
  [execute those code];
}

else if (CONDITION2 == IS MET){
  [execute these code];
}

else {
  [execute them code];
}
```

###### Getting rid of redundancies 

``` Java
public class ClassName{
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    [Main program goes here]
  }
}
```
