#### Objects and Classes

##### Definining Classes for Objects
* _object_ a real-life entity that can be distinctly identified
  * objects have properties/attributes, which are represented by data fields w/ their current values
    * eg. circle has attribute for radius
  * behavior/actions of object is defined by methods
    * eg. you can use getArea() for circle objects
* objects of the same type have the same class, & there can be many instances of a class
  * creating an instance = _instantiation_
* variables define data fields & methods to define actions
* a class has methods called _constructors_
  * constructors are designed to perform initializing actions (eg. initializing the data fields)
* you can put 2 classes in 1 file, but 1 class can be a public class

```Java
public class TestSimpleCircle {
}

class SimpleCircle {
}
```
##### Constructing Objects Using Constructors

##### Accessing Objects via Reference Variables

##### Using Classes from the Java Library

##### Static Variables, Constants, and Methods

##### Visiblity Modifiers

##### Data Field Encapsulation

##### Passing Objects to Methods

##### Array of Objects
