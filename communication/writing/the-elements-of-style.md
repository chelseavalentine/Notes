# The Elements of Style

Notes from reading _The Elements of Style_ by William Strunk, Jr.

### Elementary rules of usage

* place a comma before a conjunction introducing a subordinate clause
* "and" is the least specific conjunction, so you can usually rewrite it using its relation (e.g. "as", "although")
* omit "so" and begin clause with "as" or "since"

### Elementary principles of usage

* use active voice
  * make sentences lively by substituting a verb for "there is"/"could be heard"/some other perfunctory expression
* put statements in positive form
  * make definite assertions: avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, noncommittal language
    * i.e. use "not" for denial/inantithesis, not for evasion
  * prefer the specific over the general, the definite over the vague, and the concrete over the abstract
* omit needless words
  * refactor "the fact that" out of every sentence
  * examples of needless words: "there is no", "the question as to", "a man who", "who is", "which was"
* keep related words together
  * subject and principal verb shouldn't be separated by a phrase/clause that can be transferred to the beginning
  * modifiers, if possible, should come next to the word they modify
    * e.g. "He only found 2 mistakes" => "He found only 2 mistakes"
* place the empathetic (prominent) words of a sentence at the end
  * another prominent place is the beginning

### A few matters of form

* sentences containing parentheses should be punctuated as if the parentheses weren't there
* quotations are generally introduced by a colon and enclosed in `" "`
  * quotes grammatically in opposition to, or the direct objects of verbs, are preceded by a comma
  * quotes introduced by "that" are intended as indirect discourse, and art enclosed in quotation marks

### Words and expressions commonly misused

* "as to whether" => whether
* "but" is usually replaceable by "although"
* replace "case" by the specific object that you're writing about
* don't follow "consider" by "as" when it means "believe to be"
* "data" is plural
* "divided into" ≠ "composed of"
* "due to" isn't usable in place of "through," "because of," or "owing to"
* try replacing "etc." with "and the rest," or "and so forth"
* "factor," "feature" should indicate that you can make the sentence more direct
* "however" should never come first if it means "nevertheless"
  * if it means "in whatever way" or "to whatever extent," it comes first
* "one of the most" – don't use it
* use participles for verb knowns
  * e.g. Do you mind ~~me~~ my asking a question?
* you can usually omit "respectively" and "respective"
* "worthwhile" is a vague approval/disapproval with actions
  * "His books aren't worthwhile" becomes "His books aren't worth reading"
* "would" in first person usually requires "should'
