# Why Don't We Listen Better?: Communicating & Connecting in Relationships

* the need-to-win & to put ourselves above others causes more problems than shoddy communication
* there's a difference between feelings and thoughts
  * e.g. feeling guilty = emotion, whether we're actually guilty = thought
* helping others feel heard:
  * "Oh, really? Tell me more about [X]..."
  * "About [X]..."
  * "How much are you [concern]..."
* feelings under pressure lead to edgy, errative behavior, where we take them out on others rather than sharing them
* aim to help increase their self-confidence
  * don't take over their problem, listen with respect to show that you believe they can manage their own lives

### The talker-listener process

* things to avoid saying while listening:
  * "Why don't you..."
  * "Don't you think they had a reason for doing that?"
  * "But you could do..."
  * "That'll never work"
* no advising, agreeing, disagreeing, or defending; just ask questions
* people generally respond better when we're responsible to them, not for them
* watch out for "I feel that…" because you're probably expressing a thought, not a feeling
* take ownership of your thoughts
  * "I'm uncomfortable with how it looks"
  * "My preference would be..."
  * "The way I see it is..."
  * "As I remember it..."
  * "It seems to me..."
* advice is cheap because it's seldom taken and rarely does any good

### General listening techniques

* replace "I understand" with "How do you feel?"

* when someone's having a hard time, acknowledge their feeling

  * e.g.

    * > "I'm frustrated"
      >
      > "Tough day, huh?"

* releasing feelings works equally well when we name our own, or others do it for us

  * poetic/dramatic language can work well here

* soften your questions

  * "I'm curious about..."
  * "It seems to me that this matters to you. Tell me how this is affecting you…?"
  * "Does that fit…?" (after making a guess)
  * "How does that strike you?"

* people are cautious about sharing their feelings if they don't share theirs first

* check your translation/interpretation of what you heard with the speaker

  * "What I heard was… Is that what you meant?"

* admit ignorance

  * admit you don't know what they're saying/what's going/don't know what they should do about their situation
  * "I don't understand what you mean. Help me understand…?"
  * "Tell me that again, I didn't follow"
  * "I just got here and I don't know what happened…?"

* don't ask someone if they want to talk about something; just go straight into acknowledging their problem/feelings

* if someone shares a serious concern with you in an earlier conversation, think about it for a while, bring it up again, and listen further

###Listening techniques for special circumstances

* old folks and "boring" stories

  * when they tell their boring, repetitive, surface-level stories, try:
    * asking what they learned from their experience, what it meant to them, and how their lives were affected by it, after listening
    * "What difference has it made to you?"

* > I'm ok with tears. I assume you want to keep talking. This must matter a lot to you…?

  * > This must be very important to you

* ask about a topic much later w/ "How're you doing with [event]?"

### Making decisions together

* the person who brings it up takes first

  * > I drove by the movie theater just now and noticed a film I'd like to see. Are you interested in going with me tonight?

* acts of love often beget acts of love
