* with a sound body of theoretical knowledge, appropriate models, and numerous opportunities for personal experiencing, the process of becoming more fully human can be greatly accelerated
* one's productivity as any role is greatly enhanced by the ability to communicate well
  * when open, clear, sensitive communication takes place, the relationship is nurtured
* dysfunctional ways of relating
  * how to remain superficial

### Ch 2: Barriers to communication

* **communication spoilers:**
  * name-calling and labeling
  * diagnosing (playing amateur psychiatrist)
  * moralizing (telling another person what they should do)
  * excessive/inappropriate questioning (close-ended questions)
  * advising (giving the other person solutions to their problems)
  * diverting (pushing someone else's problems aside via distractions)
  * logical arguments
  * reassuring (trying to stop them from feeling negative emotions)
  * praising evaluatively
  * criticizing
* labeling prevents us from getting to know ourselves and others because there's no longer a person before us, only a type
* **advice is often a basic insult to the other person's intelligence**

### Ch 3: Listening is more than merely hearing

* alertness and productive tension in body language sends the signal that you understand the  importance of what they're saving and want to understand better
* **primary listener task: staying out of the speaker's way so you can discover how they view their situation**
* 4 elements to door-opener statements:
  * description of the other person's body language
  * invitation to talk/continue talking
  * silence (giving the other person time to decide what to say)
  * attending (eye contact and having a posture of involvement)
* minimal encourages:
  * "Tell me more"
  * "Oh?", "So?", "Then?", "Really?", "And?"
  * "For instance…?"
  * "I see", "Right", "Yes", "Sure"
  * "I hear you", "Go on", 
  * "Gosh", "Damn"

### Ch 4: Four skills of reflective listening

* **reflective statements** say, in a few nonjudgmental words, what the listener things the other person is experiencing

### Ch 5: Why reflective responses work

* "It sounds as if..."

### Ch 7: Improving your reflecting skills

* don't fake understanding
* don't tell the speaker you know how they feel
* choose the most accurate feeling word
* fact-finding: "Could you give me an example?"
* feeling-finding: "How did you feel when…?"
* additive responses (taking the speaker into the listener's PoV) should only be used by pros because it can be harmful

### Ch 8: The approaches to relationships

* assertion training rests upon a foundation of respect for yourself, others, and for your value system

* **the price of submissiveness is having a life chosen by others, and less satisfying relationships**

* > when someone "things" another, they also automatically "things" themselves

* > the extent to which you assert yourself determines the level of your self-esteem

### Ch 9: Developing 3-part assertion messages

1. a nonjudgmental description of the behavior to be changed,
2. a disclosure of the asserter's feelings, and
3. a clarification of the concrete, tangible effect of the other person's behavior on the asserter

* limit yourself to behavioral descriptions; don't draw inferences about the other person's motives, attitudes, character, etc.
* little things often become the major irritants of life
* **if you understate your feelings, it deprives the other of important data to motivate their behavior alteration**
* most people can increase awareness of behaviors with tangible negative effects on their lives once they've decided it's worth doing
* you're being aggressive, not assertive, if the issue doesn't pertain your personal space, or is about someone else's space
* **don't try to send an assertion for a third-party**

### Ch 10: Handling the push-push back phenomenon

* when you assert yourself, most likely you'll get defensiveness or be attacked
* don't answer a question when you're asserting; reply with a reflective listening response instead
* if it doesn't get through, you can increase affect (the feeling communicated by your tone and body), but use the same words as before
  * don't fake more/less emotions than you feel

### Ch 11: Increasing your assertive options

* reasons that evaluative praise sucks:
  * creates anxiety, invites dependency, and evokes dependency
  * is unconducive to self-reliance, -direction, and -control because these need freedom from outside control, and require inner motivation and evaluation
* **descriptive recognition:** letting another know that you value their _specific_ behavior
  * describe the actual work and behavior, not their personality or character
* **selective inattention: don't give people attention when their conversation includes phrases or words you find emotionally abusive or disrespectful**
* rewards demonstrate a lack of respect for the other person
* natural consequences are based on the normal flow of reality

### Ch 12: Conflict prevention and control

* families that tend to express open dissent and disagreement produce higher self-esteem
* establishing procedures for handling issues before they arise is good

### Ch 13: Handling the emotional components of conflict

* deal with the emotional aspects of conflict, and then the substantive issues (i.e. conflicting needs, practices disagreements, etc.)

1. respect the other person internally and externally
2. listen until you experience the other side
3. state your views, needs, and feelings

* relationships tend to falter if people don't know how to handle the differences between them

### Ch 14: Collaborative problem-solving

* alternatives leading to negative consequences: denial, avoidance, capitulation (giving in without struggling, therefore never getting needs met), dominance

1. define the problem in terms of needs, not solutions
2. brainstorm possible solutions – don't evaluate ideas
3. select solution(s) that'll best meet both parties' needs with few consequences
4. plan who'll do what/where/by when
5. implement the plan
6. check how your solution turned out later on

### Ch 15: 3 essentials for effective communication

* genuineness, non-possessive love (respect, acceptance, positive regard), empathy
* agape ("ah-GAH-pau"): concern for the well-being of others
  * loving isn't necessarily liking
