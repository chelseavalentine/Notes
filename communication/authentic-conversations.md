# Authentic Conversations: Moving from Manipulation to Truth and Commitment

### Introduction

* compliance is highly valued in organizations where power is concentrated at the top, so parent-child roles form and employees believe their unhappiness is a statement of faulty leadership

### Ch 2: Relationships that don't work at work

* the exercise of attitude assessments is a cultural statement that it isn't safe to tell the truth at work and own it
* cynicism carries a sense of entitlement: "You disappointed me, therefore my cynicism is justified."

### Ch 3: The myth of holding others accountable

* > **I decide what to make of you and your plans for me. I decide what meaning you will have in my life. I will decide the future I want to pursue and the place you have in it.**

### Ch 6: Change the conversation, change the culture

* **leadership isn't having all the right answers; it's the ability to engage others to find the best solution**
  * we need to constantly ask: Who else should be here? Whose views do we need?
* **goodwill isn't a feeling; it's a conscious choice about how to engage with others, to tell the truth as you see it — out of commitment to the business and your coworkers**
* **if you self-destruct due to disappointment, you're saying that you commitment is contingent on others**
* acknowledge the unpredictability, anxiety, or frustration of a situation and ask for help
* state risks, acknowledge difficulties (including the possibility that things won't work out)

### Ch 7: Moving from manipulation to engagement

* **manipulative language means not being direct about what you want and not giving the other person the benefit of the bigger picture**
* who do you want to be? what do you want to stand for when no one is looking?

### Ch 11: Open season – Remove the camouflage

* levels for dealing with resistance:
  1. ask for reservations
  2. raise issues of control and vulnerability getting in the way of conversation
  3. process the conversation
  4. raise the possibility of not proceeding

### Conclusion

* **Falling back into old patterns (parent or child), seeking safety, security, and a sense of well-being outside of yourself is always available. You just need to turn away from the person you want to become.**

  * > If taking this new position won't give me comfort, will it give me a sense of more fully being what I should be?

### A practical guide to authentic conversations

* state the reason for the conversation/meeting
* state your intention to resolve the issue or make it work
* seek agreement
  * "What suggestions do you have?"
  * "Would you be willing to give this a try?"
* describe the change that you're proposing
* give the business reasons for proposing the change
* ask them to frame the choices they see, and frame the choices that you see for proceeding
