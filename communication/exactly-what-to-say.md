### Notes

> I'm not sure if it's for you, but...

* indicates low pressure, but also an element of curiosity
* people often forget the part before "but" and focus on what comes after

> How open-minded would you be about...? Would you be open-minded about...? How open-minded are you about...?

> What do you know about...?

* used for overcoming the "I know best" mentality
  - question the knowledge upon which the other person's opinion was founded

> How would you feel if...?

* brings to mind emotions if the theoretical situation occurred -> motivation/reason to do things

> When would be a good time...?

> I'm guessing you haven't gotten around to...

* makes it impossible for them to use the excuse of not having done it yet; they respond with the positive (they've done it already), or explain how they're going to do the thing they said they would

> What questions do you have for me?

> Of these options...? 

> What most people do...; Most people...

> What happens next is...

* used to move conversations towards a close

> What makes you say that?

> ... enough ...?

* changes the question from "how many?" to a yes-or-no question

> Just out of curiosity...
