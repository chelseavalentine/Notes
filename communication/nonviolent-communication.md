# Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life

### Ch 1: Giving from the heart

* NVC process:
  1. observations (what's actually happening in the situation)
     1. saying what you like and don't like, without evaluation or judgment
  2. feelings (how you feel when you observe the action)
  3. needs (/desires/values that create our feelings)
  4. requests (concrete actions we request to improve our lives)

### Ch 2: Communication that blocks compassion

* classifying and judging people ("who is what"), since analyses of others are really expressions of our own needs and values
* comparisons (types of judgment) block compassion for others and ourselves
* denial of responsibility
  * common factors: others' actions, authority's dictates, group pressure, vague & impersonal forces, institutional policies, gender/social/age roles, uncontrollable impulses
  * **we're dangerous when we're unconscious of our responsibility for how we behave, think, and feel**
* thinking based on "who deserves what" blocks compassionate communication

### Ch 3: Observing without evaluating

* combining observation with evaluation => sounds like criticism
* when you use words like "always", "never", "ever", "whenever", etc. as exaggerations, you provoke defensiveness
  * using words like "frequently" or "seldom" can help combat this

### Ch 4: Identifying and expressing feelings

* you can identify mislabeled feelings when "I feel" is followed by:
  * words such as "that", "like", "as if"
  * the pronouns: I, you, he, they, she, it
  * names or nouns referring to entities
* **distinguish between what we feel and what we think we are**
  * i.e. "I feel disappointed in myself as an X" **NOT** "I feel inadequate as an X."
* **distinguish between what we feel and how we think others behave/react to us**

### Ch 5: Taking responsibility for our feelings

* > **What others do may be the stimulus of our feelings, but not the cause**

* four options for receiving negative messages:

  1. blame ourselves
     1. directing the person's judgment to heart, at great cost to our self-esteem because it inclines us toward feelings of guilt, shame, and depression
  2. blame others
  3. sense our own feelings and needs
     1. focusing attention on our own feelings and needs, we become conscious that our current feeling of hurt derives from a need for our efforts to be recognized
  4. sense others' feelings and needs
     1. being conscious of how people express their opinion

* common speech patterns that mask accountability for our own feelings:

  * use of impersonal pronouns, such as "it" or "that"
    * e.g. "It infuriates me…", "That bugs me"
  * use of "I feel X because [some pronoun other than I]..."
  * statements that only mention others' actions

* **to promote responsibility, use "I feel… because I need..."**

* if we don't value our needs, others may not either

### Ch 6: Requesting that which would enrich life

* use clear, positive concrete action language that reveals what you want
  * it's common for people to talk without being conscious of what they're asking for
* **requesting honesty: "I'd like you to tell me how you feel about what I just said, and your reasons for feeling as you do"**
* **It's a demand if the speaker criticizes or judges when they don't get what they want, otherwise, it's a request**

### Ch 7: Receiving empathetically

* common behaviors preventing us from connecting empathetically:
  * advising: "I think you should…", "How come you didn't…?"
  * one-upping
  * educating: "this'll turn into a good experience if you just..."
  * consoling: "this isn't your fault, you did the best that you could"
  * storytelling: "that reminds me of the time..."
  * shutting down: "cheer up. don't feel so bad"
  * sympathizing: "you poor thing"
  * interrogating: "when did this begin?"
  * explaining: "I could've called but..."
  * correcting: "that's not how it happened"
* **intellectual understanding blocks empathy**

* you'll find people less threatening if you hear what they're needing rather than what they're thinking about you
  * what others are observing
  * how others are feeling and the needs generating their feelings
  * what others are requesting
* reflect back (+ sanitize) messages that are emotionally-charged
* only paraphrase when it contributes to greater compassion and understanding
* "Is there more you wanted to say?"
* it's impossible to give what we don't have (e.g. empathy)

### Ch 8: The power of empathy

* **never use "but" with an angry person – empathize**
* **when we listen for feelings and needs, we no longer see people as monsters**

### Ch 9: Connecting compassionately with others

* **shame is a form of self-hatred; actions taken out of it aren't joyful or free**
  * we don't succumb to "should" and "have to"; we can only evaluate ourselves in terms of whether and how well our needs are being met – then we can learn
* **with every choice you make, be conscious of the need it serves: "I choose to… because I want..."**

### Ch 10: Expressing anger fully

* **the cause of anger lies in our thinking – in thoughts of blame and judgment**
  * use anger as a wakeup call that a need isn't being fulfilled
  * **violence comes from the belief that other people cause our pain and therefore deserve punishment**
* it's not possible to "win" by telling people what's wrong with them and shaming them
  * translate each judgment into an unmet need
* **people don't hear our pain when they believe that they're at fault**

### Ch 11: Conflict resolution and mediation

* avoid the use of language that implies wrongness
  * **don't confuse needs with strategies: needs contain no reference to anyone taking an action**
* ask "would you be willing to…?" and if not, you can implore as to why
* **non-action language exacerbates conflict: tell people how to meet your needs**

* conflict resolution can only happen right now, so that's where you need to focus
* the purpose of interrupting is to restore the process

### Ch 13: Liberating ourselves and counseling others

* "When A, I feel B, because I'm needing C. Therefore, I'd now like D."
* focus on what we want to do rather than what went wrong
