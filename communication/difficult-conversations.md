# Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most

### Ch 1: Sort out the three conversations

* each difficult conversation is really 3 conversations:
  1. the "what happened?" conversation
  2. the feelings conversation
  3. the identity conversation
* instead of making your conversations a battle of messages, make them learning conversations:
  * assume that both people bring different information and perceptions to the conversations, and there're likely things that each person doesn't know; figure out how each person understood the situation and why
  * share the impact on you and find out what they were thinking; discover your impact on them
  * understand how both of your actions interacted to produce the result
  * assume that feelings are at the heart of the situation; address each other's feelings without judgments/attributions and acknowledge them before problem-solving
  * understand the identity issues on the line, and build a more complex self-image to maintain your balance better

### Ch 2: Stop arguing about who's right: Explore each other's stories

* arguing doesn't help when you disagree; it's usually rooted in the belief that the problem is the other person and their wrong beliefs/persona â€“ it goes nowhere
  * arguing also blocks you from exploring each other's stories, and because you don't understand the other person, you're not persuasive
* we all have different information because we choose to notice and ignore different things to avoid information overwhelm
* each person knows themselves better than anyone else can, so you lack information on other people's fears, goals, etc.
* our conclusions reflect self-interest
* move from certainty to curiosity about how the other person interprets things and what information they have
* **figure out what your own story is, because we construct our stories about the world so fast that we're usually unaware of why we interpreted things a certain way**
* adopt the "and stance", i.e. both stories can be true and coexist
* the most useful question is "now that we really understand each other, what's a good way to manage this problem?"

### Ch 3: Don't assume they meant it: Disentagle intent from impact

* two mistakes: (1) assuming that you know the other person's intentions, and (2) once you clarify your intentions, assuming that the other person is no longer justified in being upset
* we assume intentions from the impact on us
* getting someone's intentions wrong is costly, because it changes how you treat them, makes them more defensive, and attributions can become self-fulfilling
* create the distinction between intent and impact by asking yourself the following:
  1. what did the other person actually say or do?
  2. what was the impact of this on me?
  3. based on this impact, what assumption am I making about what the other person intended?
* you can hold your view as a hypothesis, but share the impact on you and ask about their intentions
* be open to reflecting on the complexity of your intentions

### Ch 4: Abandon blame: Map the contribution system

* blame inhibits our ability to learn what's really causing the problem and correct it meaningfully
* instead of blaming (i.e. judging), figure out what contributed: how did we each contribute to bringing about the current situation? what can we do about it going forward?
* doling out punishments to an entity can prevent the thorough investigation of how the surrounding environment contributed to the situation

### Ch 5: Have your feelings (or they will have you)

* feelings are too powerful to remain peacefully bottled; **if handled indirectly or without honesty, they can contaminate communication**
* framing feelings out of the conversation is likely to result in outcomes that're unsatisfying for both people
* we don't cry or lose our temper because we express feelings too often, but rather because we express them too rarely
* **by keeping your feelings out of the relationship, you're keeping an important part of yourself out of it and you deprive others of the opportunity to learn and change in response to your feelings**
* learn that your feelings are as important as theirs
* don't let hidden feelings block other emotions (e.g. if you don't express anger during some moments, you may not be able to express love in other moments)
* words for feelings:
  - love: affectionate, caring, close, proud, passionate
  - anger: frustrated, exasperated
  - hurt: let down, betrayed, disappointed, needy
  - shame: embarrassed, guilty, regretful, humiliated, self-loathing
  - fear: anxious, terrified, worried, obsessed, suspicious
  - self-doubt: inadequate, unworthy, inept, unmotivated
  - joy: happy, enthusiastic, full, elated, content
  - sadness: wistful, joyless, depressed
  - jealousy: envious, selfish, covetous, anguished, yearning
  - gratitude: appreciative, thankful, relieved, admiring
  - loneliness: desolate, abandoned, empty, longing

### Ch 6: Ground your identity: Ask yourself what's at stake

*  three core identities: am I competent? am I a good person? am I worthy of love?
* clinging to a purely positive identity leaves no place in our self-concept for negative feedback (e.g. if you think you never make mistakes, then hearing that you made a mistake presents a problem, and then the only way to keep your self-identity in tact is to deny the feedback)
  - alternatively, it can lead to exaggeration of the feedback (e.g. if I'm not completely competent, then I'm completely incompetent)
* complexify your self-image (i.e. you can be multiple thinggs and have multiple behaviors and intentions): no one is _always_ anything
* learn to regain your balance
* sometimes your identity issues will be important to you, but not terribly relevant to the other person or relationship; in those scenarios, flag the problem as something that you need to work out on your own
