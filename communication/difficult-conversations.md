# Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most

### Ch 1: Sort out the three conversations

* each difficult conversation is really 3 conversations:
  1. the "what happened?" conversation
  2. the feelings conversation
  3. the identity conversation
* instead of making your conversations a battle of messages, make them learning conversations:
  * assume that both people bring different information and perceptions to the conversations, and there're likely things that each person doesn't know; figure out how each person understood the situation and why
  * share the impact on you and find out what they were thinking; discover your impact on them
  * understand how both of your actions interacted to produce the result
  * assume that feelings are at the heart of the situation; address each other's feelings without judgments/attributions and acknowledge them before problem-solving
  * understand the identity issues on the line, and build a more complex self-image to maintain your balance better

### Ch 2: Stop arguing about who's right: Explore each other's stories

* arguing doesn't help when you disagree; it's usually rooted in the belief that the problem is the other person and their wrong beliefs/persona â€“ it goes nowhere
  * arguing also blocks you from exploring each other's stories, and because you don't understand the other person, you're not persuasive
* we all have different information because we choose to notice and ignore different things to avoid information overwhelm
* each person knows themselves better than anyone else can, so you lack information on other people's fears, goals, etc.
* our conclusions reflect self-interest
* move from certainty to curiosity about how the other person interprets things and what information they have
* **figure out what your own story is, because we construct our stories about the world so fast that we're usually unaware of why we interpreted things a certain way**
* adopt the "and stance", i.e. both stories can be true and coexist
* the most useful question is "now that we really understand each other, what's a good way to manage this problem?"

### Ch 3: Don't assume they meant it: Disentagle intent from impact

* two mistakes: (1) assuming that you know the other person's intentions, and (2) once you clarify your intentions, assuming that the other person is no longer justified in being upset
* we assume intentions from the impact on us
* getting someone's intentions wrong is costly, because it changes how you treat them, makes them more defensive, and attributions can become self-fulfilling
* create the distinction between intent and impact by asking yourself the following:
  1. what did the other person actually say or do?
  2. what was the impact of this on me?
  3. based on this impact, what assumption am I making about what the other person intended?
* you can hold your view as a hypothesis, but share the impact on you and ask about their intentions
* be open to reflecting on the complexity of your intentions
