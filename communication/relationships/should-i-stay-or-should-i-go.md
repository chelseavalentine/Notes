# Should I Stay or Should I Go?: A Guide to Knowing if Your Relationship Can – and Should – Be Saved

### Ch 1: Don't all relationships have problems?

* unhealthy relationships
  * they're thinking more about/exclusively about what is good for them, not you or both of you
  * nothing is ever their fault, or they apologize and don't change at all
  * they're making your relationships with other people more difficult by what they say about you, or interferes with your contact with them
* in analyzing a relationship, you carry out of a collection of experiments, and then you'll see, with clarity, what you're dealing with and where the problems lie
* in real relationships:
  * no one can be everything you need
    * **you still need good friends, meaningful work, enjoyable hobbies, etc.**
  * **no one can make you better than you were before**
    * you're still doing all the work, but they can increase your strength
  * no one can be the one you spend all your time with
  * no one can love absolutely everything about you
  * no one can do things for you that you need to do yourself
* what relationships should have
  * respect and physical/sexual safety (+ emotional, financial, etc. safety)
  * feel loved the majority of the time
  * creates more possibilities than it takes away
  * passion and intimacy
  * should feel seen and understood

### Ch 2: Is immaturity the problem?

* he's less likely to mature if:
  * he has friends that're just as immature as he is
  * he's extremely self-centered (interprets everything that happens in terms of how it affects him, and refuses to acknowledge how his behavior contributes to problems with people)
