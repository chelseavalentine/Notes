* if you don't work on the bottom (better listening, helping, building relationships), you won't be successful at the top

* when we see others as objects, we begin provoking them to make our lives difficult

  * instead of being passive victims of misunderstandings, we become active perpetuators of it

  | **View of Myself** | **View of Others**   |
  | ------------------ | -------------------- |
  | superior           | inferior             |
  | important          | incapable/irrelevant |
  | virtuous/right     | false/wrong          |
  | **Feelings**       | **View of World**    |
  | impatient          | competitive          |
  | disdainful         | troubled             |
  | indifferent        | needs me             |

* **when you let people go on hurting themselves/others, it's usually out of self-justification**

* the Worse-Than box

  | **View of Myself** | **View of Others** |
