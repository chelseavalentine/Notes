# How to Be an Adult in Relationships

* the 5 As: (1) attention, (2) acceptance, (3) appreciation, (4) affection, and (5) allowing
  * depending on how much of these we receive, especially in early childhood, it can take different amounts of time to be ready for a relationship
* love received in the present ripples back and makes us want less from the past
* Freud: a healthy ego is "a coherent organization of mental processes," and is the part of us that can observe self, situations, and people and assess them to allow us to move towards our goals
* in healthy intimate relationships, we don't seek more than 25% of our nurturance from a partner; we learn to find the rest within ourselves
* **in life, nothing is permanently and finally satisfying**
  * yet we believe there's a person who'll be permanently satisfying
    * this belief is self-defeating and deeply disheartening
  * therefore, we want a partner to walk beside us, not try to change life's givens
* no set of parents can be nurturing enough to fulfill our needs
* psychologically healthy adults come from a background of flexibility, not severity; needs are best filled in an atmosphere of joy and forgiveness

* **you have a right to live in accord with your deepest needs, values, and wishes, and you should respect that right in others**

## Ch 2: Love and less

* "You don't understand!" may mean "I can't show you my feelings because you can't understand them."
* in healthy families, there's struggle and assistance when necessary, not frustration and shame about failure
* **we think that we're the sum of the bad things that've happened to us, but that's only true if we haven't worked on ourselves**
* in healthy relationships, you should be joining each other in your own chaoses, not to eliminate them, but to help each other tolerate them

## Ch 3: Choosing a partner

* mindful love is bonding by commitment, not attachment/clinging
* some people are more comfortable with – and only psychologically calibrated for – light relationships or friendships
* once we love ourselves, people no longer look good to us unless they are good for us
* you can't sexualize needs

## Ch 4: Romance – The first phase of relationship

* > in romance, you see the reflection of your own beseeching gaze

* people who believe they're lovable are people who love

  * instead of trying to win, think, "how can I be as loving as possible in this circumstance?"
  * **when we give what we miss, we no longer miss it as much**

* **in romance, we want what the other can give; in addiction, we crave what the other can't give**

* don't create elaborate plans for time together if it isn't mutual

## Ch 6: Fears rush in – and dangers, too

* the most empowering relationships are ones in which each partner lifts the other to a higher possession of their own being
* we need regular periods of solitude to replenish ourselves, locate new sources of creativity and self-knowledge, and discover parts of ourselves that're invisible when we're with others
* examining how you handle money can give you information on how you handle intimacy
  * e.g. getting something for free (or wanting to) == expect commitment from a partner without committing yourself
* when embarking on a project/new journey, ask "how can we do this in such a way that we become closer?"

## Ch 8: When relationships end

> We become whole through relationships and through letting go of relationships.

## Ch 9: Our commitment and how it deepens

* marriage isn't commitment; adults make commitments to a person with whom things are working/workable
  * this commitment should be withdrawn when things are no longer workable
  * unconditional love + conditional commitment
