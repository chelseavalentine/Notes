# Pragmatic Programmer

* _kaizen_: Japanese business philosophy of continuously making small improvements

### Chapter 1: A pragmatic philosophy

* instead of excuses, provide options
* don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, poor code) unrepaired; otherwise -> a decline
* “[McC95] Jim McCarthy. Dynamics of Software Development. Microsoft Press, Redmond, WA, 1995.”
* “[Ber96] Albert J. Bernstein. Dinosaur Brains: Dealing with All Those Impossible People at Work. Ballantine Books, New York, NY, 1996.”


### Chapter 2: A pragmatic approach

> shortcuts make for long delays

* don't rely on the properties of things you can't control
  - eg. using phone numbers as a user ID (phone co. could reassign area codes)

* keep track of your estimates to gauge their accuracy;
* don't make estimates on the fly; get back to the person
