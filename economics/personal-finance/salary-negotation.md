# Notes on Salary Negotiation

* there're many orgs where they suddenly get more budget, power and status if you turn out to be an expensive hire because they manage a "strong" team
  * negotiating in a spirited fashion is doing them a favor
* the "max $X that HR allows for that position" is a myth
* always keep the door to negotiations open until you're ready to make an informed, deliberate, final decision
* **a job is a deal between you and the company to exchange labor for money and other things you value**
* protect as much information as possible, since information is power
* given an offer, don't ask for more money, equity, or anything until you've explored other options
* staying positive is a rule of negotiation & one of the most valuable assets to give the impression that: (1) you still like the company, and (2) you're still excited to work there even if the numbers aren't working out
* don't be the decision-maker, talk to family and friends
* send a follow-up email confirming that you have the details right
* exploding offer is a myth
  * "There's no way that I can make a decision within X hours as I'm still wrapping up other interviews. I'll need at least Y (time) to make an informed decision."
* value companies among various axes:
  * challenge of the work
  * learning potential
  * quality of life
  * growth potential
  * salary and equity

### The fine details of negotiation

* a good negotiator is empathetic and collaborative; they try to think creatively about how to fulfill all parties' needs
* bad negotiators think of it as a zero-sum game: anything I get, you get less of
* have alternatives because a negotiation needs stakes, and you should be able to walk away if necessary

* know the average compensation of the position as a good starting point

* assert your value, especially the unique value or experience that you bring to the company

### On equity

* common trick is presenting the total value of the stock, rather than the annualized value

### Other

* can ask for other things (e.g. sponsored for conferences, books, etc.)
* when pressured to decide, remember that this is a decision to commit to a company for potentially the next several years
* even if it's only 1 company, wait until the last day to sign
