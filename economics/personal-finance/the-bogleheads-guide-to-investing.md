# The Boglehead's Guide to Investing

* > **taxes are heavy, but we're taxed twice as much by our idleness, three times as much by our pride, and four times as much by our folly**

### Ch 1: Choose a sound financial lifestyle

* have an emergency fund for 3-6 months of living expenses

### Ch 2: Start early and invest regularly

* save and invest 25% of your earnings
* earn more and spend less than you currently earn
* roth IRA is a tax-free investment matched by companies

### Ch 3: Stocks and bonds

* only buy something you'd be perfectly happy with if the market shut down for 10 years

* **stocks:** an ownership portion of a company
* **bonds:** lending an amount of money to the bond issuer, where you get a return on your money at its maturity date
  * pays interest annually/semi-annually
* **treasury issues:** the safest bond backed by the U.S. government; interest income is exempt from state and local taxes
* **T-bills, T-notes, and T-bonds:** treasury issues of <= 1 year
  * t-bills = 13, 26, or 52 weeks
  * t-notes = 2, 3, 5, or 10 years
  * t-bills > 10 years
* **TIPS**: Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities
* **U.S. saving bonds** are tax deferred up to 30 years
  * I bonds and EE bonds can't be cashed in the first year if you hold them
    * can cash within 2-30 years without the loss of principal, but if you cash before 5 years, you lose the last 3 months of interest
  * fixed yield rate for future EE bonds is announced by the TReasury each May & November; w/ minimum guaranteed yield at 3.526% if held for 20 years
* treasury issues are auctioned off at regular intervals
  * can manage it yourself online, but you have to maintain the papertrail
* **government agency securities**
  * issues **mortgage-backed securities (MBS)**
    * GNMA (Government National Mortgage Association) guarantees timely repayment of both the principal and interest
  * buying higher risk (non-GNMA backed) => higher yields
* **corporate bonds**
  * corporations need money for business purposes; the higher the credit rating, the lower the yield
* **municipal bonds**
  * stale and local governments need $; these are free from federal tax and free from tax in the issued states
    * local bonds are triple-tax free
  * usually, the yield is less, so it makes sense for people in the highest tax bracket
    * some municipal bonds are subject to IRS' Alternative Minimum Tax
* maturity and duration
  * bond and bond fund values are inversely proportional to interest rates: e.g. -4.3%: +1%
* selecting the right bond fund
  * find one matching your investment time horizon
  * don't time interest hikes
  * match your fund to your risk tolerance
* bonds have low correlation to stocks, so can balance portfolio
* guideline: owning your age in bonds (e.g. 20% of portfolio = bonds)

### Ch 4: Mutual funds, ETFs,...

* **mutual funds**
  * pools money from many investors to buy securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) & you get a small portion of the collected interest
  * equity mutual funds include: (aggresive) growth funds, growth & income funds, international funds, sector & speciality funds (e.g. REITs: Real Estate Investment Trusts)
* **funds of funds**
  * investing in other mutual funds; is great to do as you get closer to retirement because it's ultra stable/secure
* **annuities:** investments with an insurance wrapper
* **fixed annuities**
  * a blank CD; insurance product agreeing to pay you a specific rate of return (4-6%) for a specific period of time (1-5 years)
    * but the gotcha is that there's a high 1 year rate, and lower subsequent rates, and/or surrender fee for early selling (can last up to 10 years)
  * offers tax deferral, even when paid with non-qualified (after-tax) funds
* **variable annuities**
  * can invest in subaccounts (mutual funds); has high expense rates
  * offers tax deferral, & your money is separated from the insurance company's (unlike fixed annuities)
* **immediate annuities**
  * contract w/ an insurance company where they'll pay you a specific amount of money on a regular basis for the rest of your life
  * annuities don't offer much to most investors
* **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)**
  * mutual funds that trade like stocks on an exchange; appeals to short- and long-term investors; super low cost
  * are priced continuously throughout the day

### Ch 5: Preserve your buying power with inflation-protected bonds

* real return = remaining money minus inflation
  * bonds & TIPs => guaranteed positive real return
* **I bonds** (inflation bonds) are U.S. saving bonds, acquired via the Treasury
  * has a real rate, the amount you will receive over & above inflation
    * but this is taxed; best to cash them out when you're in a lower tax bracket b/c they're tax-deferred for up to 30 years
* TIPS' guaranteed rates are usually higher than I Bond fixed rates
  * purchasing at an auction is best because you get back your principal
  * major downside: paying taxes on income you won't receive until maturity (phantom income)

### Ch 7: Keep it simple – make index funds the core, or all of your portfolio

* even with simple, no-brainer passive investing, you can outperform at 70% chance
* you could just invest in an index fund and forget about it
* don't buy load index funds with high annual expense rates

### Ch 8: Asset allocation – the cornerstone of successful investing

* **Efficient Market Theory (EMT):** it's impossible to beat the market because existing share prices already reflect all relevant information
* there're years in which the international index outperforms domestic, & vice-versa
  * recommendation: keep 20-40% of your portfolio in international stock
* recommendations for young investors: 55% domestic large-cap stocks, 25% domestic mid-/small-cap stocks, 20% immediate-term bonds

### Ch 9: Costs matter – keep them low

* funds with loads consistently underperform no-load funds

### Ch 10: Taxes – mutual fund taxation

* use index- or tax-managed funds in taxable accounts
* tax-managed funds reduce/eliminate shareholder taxes via:
  * low turnover
  * HIFO (highest-in, first-out) accounting by selling the highest cost shares first
  * tax-loss harvesting to even out tax wins
* tax-managing strategies for you:
  * buy fund shares after the distribution date so you don't pay taxes on distribution
  * sell profitable shares after the new year so that the tax is reporting a year later
  * harvest tax losses
    * balance out gains and use it to report less income (-$3k max to income)

### Ch 11: Managing your portfolio for max tax efficiency

* invest in tax-sheltered accounts like the 401k, 403b, IRA, etc. for retirement
  * but 401k plans have high cost & capital gains are converted into ordinary income
  * invest up to the company match and invest the rest in a roth IRA
* **Individual Retirement Account (IRA)**: a personal savings account giving you tax advantages while saving for retirement
  * can withdraw from your IRA at a penalty, but there're exceptions to the penalty
* nondeductible traditional IRAs turn capital gains into higher-taxed ordinary income
  * are convertible into Roth IRAs (called a backdoor Roth because high-income individuals are otherwise ineligible)
* Roth IRAs aren't tax deductible, but securities in IRAs aren't taxed
  * upon withdrawals, traditional IRAs are fully taxed, nondeductible ones are partially taxed, and Roth IRAs aren't taxed at all
* the least tax efficient to the most tax efficient: high yield bonds, international bonds, taxable domestic bonds, TIPS, REITs, balanced funds, stock trading accounts, small-value stocks, small-cap stocks, large-value stocks, international stocks, large-growth stocks, most stock-index funds, tax-managed funds, EE & I bonds, tax-exempt (muni) bonds

### Ch 15: How to manage a windfall successfully

* deposit money and leave it alone for 6 months (emotions go away by then)
* know what you can buy after tax, fees, etc.
* make a wishlist for 1y, 5y, 10y, and now
* get professional help

### Ch 17: Rebalancing

* take money from selling high assets and direct the money into target asset allocation
