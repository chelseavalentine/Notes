# Rich Dad, Poor Dad

* > How can I afford it?

* > Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal.

## Lesson 1: The rich don't work for money

* a nice car and house don't necessarily mean you're rich or know how to make money

* if you can't make up your mind decisively, then you'll never learn how to make money

* if you learn life's lessons, you'll do well; if not, life'll just continue to push you around

  * some get angry & push back, but they push back at their boss or faily when it's life pushing them

* > If you think I'm the problem, then you have to change me. If you realize that you're the problem, then you can change yourself, learn something, and grow wiser.

* people's lives are forever controlled by 2 emotions: fear and greed

* most people don't tell the truth in fear of losing their job/money/etc.

  * upon receiving money, joy, desire and greed temporarily take over and wash it away

* once a person stops searching for information and self-knowledge, ignorance sets in

* > Learn to use your emotions to think, not think with your emotions

## Lesson 2: Why teach financial literacy?

* it's not how much money you make, it's how much money you keep

* > an asset puts money in my pocket, a liability takes money out of my pocket

  * **assets:** real estate, stocks, bonds, notes, intellectual property
  * **liabilities:** mortgage, consumer loans, credit cards

* money only accentuates the cash-flow pattern running in your head

* if you make bad investments (e.g. in a home), you also lose out on investment experience, since you have less money to invest with

* > Average mutual fund lawyers are too busy working to pay off taxes and mortgages, save for their children's college, and pay off credit cards. They don't have the time to study investing, so they rely on the expertise of the manager of a mutual fund.

* > Wealth is a person's ability to survive so many number of days fortward – or, if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?

## Lesson 3: Mind your own business

* the rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements
* financial struggle is often directly the result of people working all their lives for someone else
* real assets:
  * businesses that don't require your presence
  * stocks, bonds
  * income-generating real estate
  * notes (IOUs)
  * royalties from intellectual properties
  * anything that has value, produces income or appreciates, and has a ready market

## Lesson 4: The history of taxes and the power of corporations

> each dollar in my asset column was a great employee, working hard to make more employees and by the boss a new Porsche with before-tax dollars.

* financial intelligence derives from knowledge in:
  * accounting
  * investing
  * understanding markets
  * the law (tax advantages, protection from lawsuits)

## Lesson 5: The rich invent money

* often in the real world, it's not the smart who get ahead, but the bold
  * if fear is too strong, genius is suppressed
* today's wealth is in information, not land
* games reflect behavior, they're instant feedback systems; games give you a customized lecture
* waiting on luck is like waiting for the lights to be green for 5 miles before starting your trip
* the single most powerful asset we have is our mind. If it's trained well, it can create enormous wealth
* the problem with "secure" investments is that they're often sanitized (i.e. made so safe that the gains are less)
* the smartert  you are, the better chance you have of beating the odds
  * it's not gambling if you know what you're doing; it's gambling to throw your money into a deal and pray
* great opportunities aren't seen with your eyes, they're seen with your mind

## Lesson 6: Work to learn – don't work for money

* you want to know a little about a lot

* job is an acronym for "Just Over Broke" (??? lol)

* seek work for what you'll learn, moreso than what you'll earn

* learn how to get over failure and rejection

* > I'm not interested in going to the gym, but I go because I want to feel better and live longer. Once I get there and am in motion, it's a pleasure.

* > They focus on perfecting their skillse and building a better hamburger than the skills of setting and delivering the hamburger

## Lesson 7: Overcoming obstacles

* the primary difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they manage fear

* 5 main reasons why financially literate people may still not earn money: (1) fear, (2) cynicism, (3) laziness, (4) bad habits, (5) arrogance

* winning means being unafraid to lose

* failure inspires winners; failure defeats losers

* most people don't play to win, they play not to lose

* doubt is expensive; and unchecked doubt plus fear creates a cynic

  * cynics criticize, winners analyze

* the words "I can't afford it" are a lie

* > What I know makes me money. What I don't know loses me money.

  * arrogance = you believe what you don't know isn't important

## Lesson 8: Getting started

* find a reason greater than reality
  * look to your "I don't want"s and "want"s
* make daily choices
  * invest in education
* choose friends carefully
* master the formula and then learn a new one
* pay yourself first: the power of self-discipline
  * manage your: (1) cash flow, (2) people, (3) personal time
* pay your brokers well: the power of good advice
  * the real skill is to manage & reward the people smarter than you in some technical area
* use assets to buy luxuries: the power of focus
* choose heroes: the power of myth
  * heroes make things look easy; making it look easy convinces us to be just like them

## Lesson 9: Additional things

* profits are made in the buying, not in the selling
* action always beats inaction
