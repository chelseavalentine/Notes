### Ch 8: The motorway to Dublin

* **in investing, you get what you _don't_ pay for**
* **backdoor Roth IRA:** you can contribute to a nondeductible traditional IRA and then immediately convert it into a Roth IRA
  * but to get any benefit, you must ensure there's no money in any type of IRA at the end of the calendar year

  * isn't taxed upon withdrawal either, if spent on healthcare
  * keep a running list/proof of approved health expenditures to avoid paying tax on the money you use for non-health later on
  * $3.3k+ individual limit
* if bonds do well and stocks poorly, balance it out by selling some bonds to by some stocks
  * based on asset allocation plan: % US stock, % international stock, % bonds

### Ch 9: Getting off the motorway

* real estate investments => deprecation of real estate => tax breaks, therefore you can claim a loss
  * upon selling, depreciation is recaptured at a 25% tax rate, therefore it's only good if your tax rate is much higher than that
* **spend less than 20% of your gross income on housing** (L O L)
* don't get a mortgage that's more than 2x your gross income
* whole life insurance is a monthly/annual premium, with lower premiums the longer you pay them
  * can borrow from it tax-free, therefore it's deducted with interest upon its payout to its beneficiary
  * hybrid investment/insurance product
* keep risky/fun investments to at most 5-10% of your portfolio

### Ch 10: Paying the Help

* generally, the higher the sales commission, the worse the product is because good products sell themselves
  * good investments/products are bought, not sold
* only pay for financial planning with an hourly fee (200-400 dollars); pay for asset management with an annual fee (flat, 1,000-5,000 dollars) or a small percentage of AUM (Assets Under Management)

* increase automobile/renter insurance policy liability limits to 100,000s and get an umbrella policy on top of that
  * $1-5MM umbrella policy above your auto/home policy limits
* you can shield $140k/child from creditors, using 529 accounts
* maxing out retirement accounts both achieves financial security and protects your assets in a lawsuit
* **limit your money in any bank to the limit insured by the FDIC**
* **limit the risk of an insurance company bankruptcy affecting you by owning many small policies from different companies**
* if home equity isn't protect in your state, it's wise to take the maximum time to pay off your home
* **dangerous assets:** one that carry substantial liability
  * e.g. rental property, recreational vehicles, side businesses, etc.
  * safe assets can be seized because of a dangerous asset; can use an LLC to separate dangerous assets from safe ones

### Ch 12: Estate planning made simple
