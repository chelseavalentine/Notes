# Performing Under Pressure: The Science of Doing Your Best When It Matters Most

### Ch 1: The Power of Pressure

* negative behavior patterns leading to divorce:
  * negative criticism by stating complaints as defects in your partner
  * contempt: statements coming from a relative position of superiority
  * defensiveness: making excuses for your behavior
  * stonewalling & emotional withdrawal
* people get confused about time pressure and the difference between getting stuff done and doing good work
* **if you believe the only way to be successful under pressure is to perform better than ever (i.e. perfectly), then you stop trusting your capabilities and start sabotaging yourself**

### Ch 2: The Stress of Pressure

* **pressure moments:** stressful moments in which the consequences or results matter
  * stressful moments don't necessarily matter towards your success or survival
* you can ask yourself these questions to determine whether it's stress or pressure:
  * does the situation really call for the reaction I'm having?
  * am I wearing myself down by overreacting when I don't need to?
  * will my performance in this situation actually threaten my success?
* in most pressure situations, you don't need to be perfect; you just need to deliver the task or behavior required for the situation

### Ch 3: The Nature of Pressure

* 3 major determinants for why we underperform under pressure:
  1. The outcome is important to you
  2. The outcome is uncertain
  3. You feel you're responsible for, and are being judged on, the outcome

### Ch 4: The Anatomy of Choking

* thinking about people's reactions takes up critical memory to store and/or process information

### Ch 5: How Pressure Affects Our Thinking

* **cognitive appraisal:** how we make sense of our world and how we'll handle them
* playing not to lose vs. playing to win: very different

### Ch 6: Pressure Traps

* support frequently magnifies performance pressure and compromises skill-based tasks
  * due to our need to be accepted and our primal fear of abandonment
* incentives, because there's more at stake, making it more about the consequences of failure
  * it adds to the pressure if you tell yourself you want or need them
* competition trap; there's a ranking mindset and an excellence mindset
  * **ranking mindset:** win-at-all-costs approach driven by insecurity and needing to prove oneself
  * **excellence mindset:** focus on developing yourself to your fullest capacity
