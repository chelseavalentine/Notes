# The Upside of Stress: Why Stress is Good For You, and How to Get Good at It

* study concluded that it wasn't stress alone that was killing people, it was also the belief that stress was harmful
* proposed definition: "stress is what arises when something you care about is at stake"
* steps to cultivate a stress mindset
  * acknowledge stress when you feel it; allow yourself to notice it and how it affects your body
  * welcome the stress by recognizing it's a response to something you care about
    * what's at stake? why does it matter to you?
  * make use of the energy stress gives you, instead of wasting that energy trying to manage your stress
    * what can you do right now that reflects your goals and values?
* practice mindset mindfulness by paying attention to how your current stress mindset operates in your life

## Ch 2: Beyond fight or flight

* taking doses of stress hormones right before a therapy session can improve the effectiveness of treatment for anxiety and phobias
* John Hopkins study: women who reported greater stress during pregnancy had babies born with superior brain development and higher heart rate variability (biological measure of resiliency to stress)
* when you're stressed, your body prepares you to face whatever challenge
  * breathing deepens to provide more oxygen, heart rate increases to deliver more sugar, fat, and oxygen to muscles and brain; stress hormones help you use that energy more efficiently
* when survival is on the line, biological changes occur & go into fight-or-flight mode, but with less threatening situations, the body and brain shift into the **challenge response**
  * the challenge response gives you energy and helps you perform under pressure
    * you feel focused, but not fearful, emit higher levels of DHEA, helping you recover and learn from stress
* stress can help you be a better version of yourself b/c oxytocin (hormone whose primary function is to build and strengthen social bonds) is released
  * it's good for cardiovascular health (stress can literally strengthen your heart)
* built-in stress hormones help you recover faster
  * people who release higher levels of these hormones during a stressful experience tend to bounce back faster, with less lingering distress
* during recovery process:
  * may keep replaying incident with alternate responsives, and can't stop thinking about it
  * is great because it encourages you to reflect and to remember lessons

## Ch 3: A meaningful life is a stressful life

* even though most people view stress as harmful, higher levels of stress seem to go along with things we want: love, health, and satisfaction with our lives

* > people with very meaningful lives worry more and have more stress than people with less meaningful lives

  * > stress seems to be an inevitable consequence of engaging in roles and pursuing goals that feed our sense of purpose

  * > even when the stress we're under doesn't seem inherently meaningful, it can trigger the desire to find meaning – if not now, then in the broader context of our lives

    * humans have an innate instinct and capacity to make sense of their suffering

* taking time to fully process and make meaning from stress can transform it from something that drains you into something that sustains you

* > **When you think life should be less stressful, feeling stressed can seem like a sign that you're inadequate: if you were strong/smart/good enough, then you wouldn't be stressed. Stress becomes a sign of personal failure, rather than evidence that you're human. This kind of thinking, in part, explains why viewing stress as harmful increases the risk of depression. In this mindset, you're more likely to feel overwhelmed and helpless.**

* embracing stress is an act of bravery, one that requires choosing meaning over avoiding discomfort

  * > Being good at stress isn't about being untouched by adversity or being unruffled by difficulties – it's about allowing stress to awaken in you the core human strength of courage, connection, and growth.

## Ch 4: How anxiety helps you rise to the challenge

* participants who told themselves "I am excited" instead of "I am calm" felt better able to handle the pressure

* a positive view of anxiety can also make you less likely to burn out in a demanding job

* > before [X], I feel bad, but maybe what I really feel is determined.

* people are more likely to have a challenge response if they focus on their resources

  * personal strengths, preparations, post-challenge triumphs, support of loved ones

## Ch 5: How caring creates resilience

* if we focus on comforting, helping, and caring for loved ones, we experience hope and connection
  * focusing on relieving our own distress leads us to feel stuck in fear
  * helping others decreases people's feeling of time scarcity more than receiving extra time
* **if you see yourself as a part of something bigger – a team, organization, community, or mission – it takes the toxicity out of striving**
  * it's more about how you see your role within your community: what you want to contribute and the change you want to create
* when you don't have a lot of support around you, it's easy to feel like you're the only one struggling
* if you wish you had someone else's life, you know nothing of the other person's life
  * they have burdens that you couldn't believe; each of us have private heartache, is tormented by our personal demons, and is overwhelmed by the demands of our day
* **if you hide parts of yourself, you miss out on significant changes of connection**
* when you take a tend-and-befriend approach to stress, even contagious stress can be strengthening

## Ch 6: How adversity makes you stronger

* there's a widestread belief that traumatic events lead to an increased risk of despression, anxiety, and illness
  * **it's shown that a history of negative life events can protect us against these outcomes because adversity leads to resilience**
  * people aren't doomed to be damaged by adversity
* setbacks are inevitable and hitting an obstacle means it's time to draw on your resources
* don't chastize people for their mistakes, tell them about similar incidents and give them empathy and support
