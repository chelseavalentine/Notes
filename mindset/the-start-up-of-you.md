# The Start-Up of You

### Ch 1: All humans are entrepreneurs

* "Ready, aim, fire" has been replaced by "Aim, fire, aim, fire,..."

  * searching for a job only when you're unemployed or unhappy at work has been replaced by the mandate to always be generating opportunities

* > success is fragile, and perfection is fleeting; the moment you begin to take success for granted is the moment a competitor lunges for your jugular

* **"permanent beta" is essentially a lifelong commitment to continuous personal growth**

### Ch 2: Develop a competitive advantage

* **assuming that your basic economic needs are taken care of, soft assets are ultimately more important**
  * because soft assets (skills, connections, experiences) may be abstract, there's a tendency for people to underestimate them when pondering career strategy
* **the person passionate about what he or she is doing will outwork and outlast the person motivated solely by making money**
* accept the uncertainty, especially early on â€” later in your career, you may have more specific, thought-out aspirations
* the "market" is an abstract thing; it consists of the people who make decisions that affect you and whose needs you must serve: your boss, coworkers, clients, direct reports, and others
* **no matter what the demand, you're not going to be the most competitive unless your own passions and strengths are in play**
* trade-offs are inevitable when you're balancing different considerations such as the market realities of employment and your own natural interests

### Ch 3: Plan to adapt

* > **They invest in the stock market and neglect investing in themselves. They focus, in short, on hard assets instead of soft assets.**

* > **Throwing your heart into something is great, but when any one thing becomes all that you stand for, you're vulnerable to an identity crisis when you pivot to a Plan B. Establish an identity independent of your employer, city, and industry.**

* > pivoting isn't throwing a dart on the map and then going there; it's changing direction or your path to get somewhere _based on what you've learned along the way_

* **what you're doing now doesn't have to be failing for it to make sense to shift**

* > [A] career inflection point results from a subtle but profound shift in the operating environment, where the future of your career will be determined by the actions you take in response

  * **it'll usually require you to either change your skills or change your environment**

* **build up your soft assets and proactively embrace new technology so that if and when the inflection point does come, you're ready to swiftly parlay skills into a Plan B**

  * the best Plan B is different but very much related to what you're already doing

* one way to begin the process of pivoting is to start your potential Plan B on the side (start learning the skill during the evenings and weekends)

* with a Plan Z, you'll at least know that you can tolerate failure; without it, you could be frozen in fear contemplating the worst-case scenarios

### Ch 4: It takes a network

* if you're playing a solo game, you'll always lose out to a team
* relationships matter no matter the organization or seniority level, because every job boils down to interacting with people
* **a slightly less-competent person who gets along with others and contributes on a team can be better for the company than someone who's 100% competent but isn't a team player**
* Relationship-builders try to help other people first; they don't keep score. They're aware that many good deeds get reciprocated, but they're not calculated about it. They think about their relationships all the time, not just when they need something.

### Ch 5: Pursue breakout opportunities

* even if you don't have an immediate reason to actively look for an explicit opportunity, it's important to keep generating professional opportunities anyway

  * this builds up the opportunity muscle memory: the more you try, the more you strengthen your intuitive sense of how, where, and why opportunities enter your career
  * serendipity involves being alert to potential opportunity and acting on it
  * opportunities don't float like clouds; they're attached to people; if you're looking for opportunities, you're really looking for people

* > **If you want to figure out how resourceful you can be, shrink your budget. Move your deadlines up. See how you cope. This may make you more resilient to actual hardships that inevitably arise.**

* **great opportunities almost never fit your schedule**

* **the opportunity you generate or find will likely be shrouded in ambiguity and uncertainty; frequently, it won't be completely clear that it's better than another opportunity**

### Ch 6: Take intelligent risks

* > There's competition for good opportunities, and because of that, if you can intelligently take on risk, you'll find opportunities others miss. Where others see a red light, you'll see green.

* > **If you don't have to seriously think about the risk involved in a career opportunity, it's probably not the breakout opportunity you're looking for.**

* > **to keep ancestors alive, our brains evolved to trick us into making 3 mistakes: overestimating threats, underestimating opportunities, and underestimating resources**

* > **You will never be fully certain. Don't conflate uncertainty with risk.**

* pursue opportunities where others misperceive risk
