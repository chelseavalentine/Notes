# Originals: How Non-Comformists Move the World

### Creative destruction

* > The reasonable person adapts themselves to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to themself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable ones.

* > people who suffer the most from a given state of affairs are paradoxically the least likely to question, challenge, reject, or change it

  * justifying the default system is soothing; it's an emotional painkiller. If the world is supposed to be this way, then we don't need to be dissatisfied with it
    * **acquiescence robs us of the moral outrage to stand against injustice and the creative will to consider alternative ways that the world could work**

* the more you value achievement, the more you come to dread failure

* you can't be original in one area without being stable in others

* entrepreneurs are significantly more risk-averse than the general population

### Blind investors and one-eyed investors

* our intuitions are only accurate in domains where we have a lot of experience

### Out on a limb

* **she needed to learn how to communicate differently – to speak up in a way that she won credibility instead of losing it**

* > Great spirits have always encountered opposition from mediocre winds

* in one study across industries: the more frequently employees voiced ideas & concerns upward, the less likely they were to receive promotions and raises over a 2-year period

  * people are often punished for trying to exercise power without status
    * (is it true that you must have status before you can make a change?)

* putting your worst foot forward in negotiations

  * powerful communication (emphasizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses) makes sense if the audience is supportive, but this isn't likely the case if you're making suggestions for change or pitching ideas, since they're looking for holes
  * leading with weakness disarms the audience
  * includes the acknowledgment of the limitations
  * people rated critical book reviewers as 14% more intelligent & 16% greater literacy expertise than the complimentary reviewer
  * makes you more trustworthy

* when you present a suggestion/new idea, realize you've got much greater understanding because you've thought about the idea more

  * need to rinse and repeat our ideas for them to stick
  * you'll inevitably undrecommunicate your vision

* **only when (1) you believe your actions matter, and (2) care deeply, will you consider speaking up**

* at work, our sense of commitment and control depends more on our direct boss than anyone else

  * determining our bond with the organization and our span of influence

* as much as agreeable people may love us, they often hate conflict more

  * disagreeable people, in contrast, experienced the greatest joy when they were criticizing, confronting, or challenging others

* **the middle segment of a hierarchy is dominated by insecurity, because now that you have a bit of respect, you value your standing and don't want to jeopardize it**

* > similarly, when women offer suggestions for improvement, managers judge them as less loyal than men who were less likely to implement their proposals

* > when it  blew up, my commitment to this change was confused with my personal frustration at not advancing in my own career. It was always me-focused

  * extensive research shows that when women speak up on behalf of others, they avoid backlash because they're being communal

### Fools rush in: timing, strategic procrastination, and the first-mover disadvantage

* > Never put off until tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow

* just because you weren't first doesn't mean you're worse off… you just have those who came before you to learn from

  * most good things take a long time to figure out
  * can observe market changes & shifting consumer tastes and adjust accordingly

### Goldilocks and the trojan horse: creating and maintaining coalitions

* > it's precisely the minor differences in people who are otherwise alike that form the basis of feelings of strangeness and hostility between them

* to form alliances, originals can temper their radicalism by smuggling their real vision inside a trojan horse

### Rebel with a cause

* **…consistently challenges the status quo, operating differently by instead using a logic of appropriateness: what does a person like me do in a situation like this? Instead of looking outward to predict the outcome, you look inwards.**

* reasoning (w/ children) instead of disciplining is a mark of esteem for the listener, an indication of faith in their ability to comprehend, develop, and improve
  * when you exercise discipline with explanations and highlight standards of conduct/morals/ethial code, the rules are more likely to be followed, and it gives autonomy to choose one's own values
  * explanations to why behaviors are inappropriate with references to their impact on other people leads to empathy for others and guilt
* when our character is praised, we internalize it as part of our identities
* if we want to encourage originality, the best step we can take is to raise our children's aspirations by introducing them to different kinds of role models

### Rethinking group think

* the benefits of group cohesion = enhanced communication & being secure enough in your role to be able to challenge one another

* they found that when founders had the commitment blueprint, the firm's failure rate was 0 (compared to the skills or star employee blueprints)

  * commitment meant that the person matches the company's values and norms
  * this is at least true up until IPO because it's harder to attract, retain, and integrate a diverse workforce

* dissenting opinions are useful even when they're wrong because they contribute to the detection of novel situations and qualitatively better solutions

* **social bonds don't drive group think: overconfidence and reputational concerns do**

* while it can be appealing to assign a devil's advocate, it's much more powerful to unearth one

* > the greatest tragedy of mankind comes from the inability of people to have thoughtful disagreement to find out what's true

### Rocking the boat and keeping it steady

* if you want people to modify their behavior, the way you pose it matters
  * if it's a safe behavior: emphasize the good things that'll happen if they do it, so they want to obtain those benefits
  * if the behavior is risky: accumulate the bad things that'll happen if they don't change
