# The Art of Extraordinary Confidence

### Chapter 1

* what do you want? what do you really want?

### Chapter 2: Excuses

* next time you're pissed off at someone, ask yourself what kind of agreement you would like to make with them to be on the same page

### Chapter 3: Stories

* our stories determine how we see ourselves, forming our identity
* "What beliefs would I need to have to get to where I want to go? To achieve what i want to achieve? To experience what I want to experience?"
* self-hate serves one function: to keep us safe; you get to avoid all of the uncomfortable situations

### Chapter 4: Fear

* **fear = pain; the pain of not doing what you know on some level that you're capable of; the ache of watching life pass you without fully participating and seeing how little has changed; the pain of hundreds of missed opportunities for connection, excitement, happiness, and joy**
* first fear: fear of your own feelings; people are terrified of negative feelings and ashamed of having them; we fear others will judge us for having them
  * hold uncomfortable sensations like holding a scared child who just woke up from a nightmare; bathe the sensation in love (it's okay for you to be here, you can be scared as long as you like; I love you)
  * your fear story is like a kid who's afraid of a monster behind.a door; it's not real; you don't have to take it so seriously
* fear is an invitation for you to take action, to approach and do the very thing that a part of you wants to run and hide from

### Chapter 5: Action

* **action is the ultimate key to ever-increasing success and confidence in any area of life; the opposite holds true, too: inaction is the primary reason for low confidence and a lack of success**
* fear ≠ danger (e.g. being judged or disliked isn't dangerous; walking up to an attractive person and talking to them isn't dangerous)
* "Am I willing to feel some discomfort in order to get what I really want?"

#### 9 ways to take consistent, badass, unstoppable action all the time

1. get clarity of vision
   1. What do you want to do? attempt? What would you like to start/create? Who would you talk to?
2. breakdown goals into tasks that need to be done, or group tasks into a few
3. "Fuck it" to each excuse
4. do-muscle: think less, do more
5. learn by doing
6. don't delay
7. imperfect action
8. play the long game
9. post-action spams
   1. thoughts of being exposed, wondering what they thought, etc. just prove you expanded; wait out the feeling

### Ch 6: Money

* **by holding back your talents and abilities, limiting yourself and your career/business success so as not to hurt others by earning money, you become completely ineffective**
* **money is a neutral reflection of output; the more people you serve, and the more profoundly you impact their lives, the more money you'll earn**

### Ch 7: Love

* **how we defend our hearts:**
  * constant distractions
  * head games: anxiety, overthinking
  * **wet blanket: "Don't get too excited/your hopes up. It won't work out anyway"**
  * social anxiety
* **instead of asking yourself this, ask yourself that:**
  * **Will they want to talk to me?  → What do I like about this person?**
  * **How will they respond to me? → How can I tell them this?**
  * **Will they like me back? → I wonder who that person is and what they're like?**
* **start expressing your love more freely and let them have whatever reactions and thoughts they will**
  * "I really enjoy talking with you. We need to do this more often."
  * "You are hilarious"

### Ch 8: Asking

* **blockers to asking for what you want**
  * I'm bothering them
  * they'll be upset or offended
  * they won't like me for asking
  * they'll think I'm greedy
  * they'll think I'm pushy
  * they'll think I'm desperate and needy
* **boldness**
  * **when you make a request and you have no clue what the outcome will be**
  * **when you make a request when every part of your body is telling you it won't work out**
* assume a "yes" when asking
* in any area, ask "what does this person need right now?" and "how can I provide value?"

### Ch 9: Power

* **power = the ability to choose your own destiny, direction, and actions**

* > **Why are you valuing other people's opinions so highly? You know who you are. You know your positive qualities, what you bring to others, what makes you unique and significant. Why're you putting another person's perspective above your own? They don't know you.**

* **instead of thinking about how you're perceived, think about how you can make others feel at ease, know they're accepted, and help them see how awesome they are**

* **Don't say "No wait; I haven't figured out why I'm so scared yet," just jump in and you'll figure out the rest later by necessity**

* **Drop the committee method. No one is in charge of your life for you. What do you want? What would it bring to your life? What do you not want?**
