# The Confidence Gap

* if you had unlimited confidence,
  * How would you behave differently?
  * How would you treat yourself differently?
  * **How would you talk to yourself?**
  * What sort of things would you start doing?
  * **What would you stop doing?**
* **the more we avoid discomfort, the more we base actions on how we feel instead of what's important in life**
