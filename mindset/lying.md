# _Lying_ by Sam Harris

* lying, even about the smallest mattres, needlessly damages personal relationships and public trust

* **to lie:** to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication

* **all forms of lying – including white lies intended to spare feelings – are associated with less satisfying relationships

* types of lies:

  * acts of commission (the bad things we do)
  * acts of omission (the good things we fail to do)

* false encouragement is a kind of theft: it steals time, energy, and motivation that a person could put towards another purpose

* **liars trust those they lie to less, so in protecting their egos and interpreting their own behavior as justified, they deprecate those they lie to**

* to lie is to erect a boundary between the truth we're living and others' perceptions of us

  * **by lying we deny others our view of the world; the dishonesty influences the choices they make and often determines the choices they _can_ make, in ways we cannot predict**

  if we shorten the timespan, it can appear to undermine the rational for living truthfully; given more time, we often think it's better to live honestly than tell consoling lies
