# The Happiness Advantage: How a Positive Brain Fuels Success in Work and Life

* if all you strive for is diminishing the bad, you;ll only attain the average and miss out on the opportunity to exceed the average
* **happiness isn't the belief that we don't need change; it's the realization that we can**
* even the smallest shots of positivity can give people a serious competitive edge
  * e.g. study where doctors given candy they couldn't eat => 20% better diagnoses
* methods to boost mood
  * find something to look forward to
  * spending money on other people ("pro-social spending")
* **when we reconnect ourselves with the pleasure of "the means" rather than only focusing on "the ends," we adopt a mindset more conducive not only to enjoyment, but also to better results**
  * the fastest way to disengage an employee is to tell them their work is meaningful only because of a paycheck
* **when people feel helpless in one area, they not only give up in that area, but overlearn the lesson and apply it to other situations**
* **when we encounter an unexpected challenge/threat, the only way to save ourselves is to hold onto the people around us and not let go**
* boss/employee relationship = single most important relationship you can cultivate at work
