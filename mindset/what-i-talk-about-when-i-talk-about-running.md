# What I Talk About When I Talk About Running

* > **Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.**

* to keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm, that's the important thing for long-term projects

  * > **Once you set the pace, the rest will follow.**

* > **the hour I spend running, maintaining my own, silent, private time is important to help me keep my mental well-being**

  * an important thing about annoying/bad things that occurred during the day: "emotional hurt is the price you have to pay in order to be independent"

* > **When criticized unjustly, or when someone I'm sure will understand me doesn't, I go running for a little longer than usual.**

  * running longer physically exhausts that portion of discontent and reminds him how weak he is, and his abilities' limitations

* **you really need to prioritize in life and figure out how to divide your time and energy. If you don't have a system set by a certain age, you'll lack focus and your life will be out of balance.**

  * > Having the kind of body that easily puts on weight was perhaps a blessing in disguise. I.e., if I don't want to gain weight, I have to workout hard every day, watch what I eat, and cut down on indulgences.

  * **We should consider ourselves lucky that the red light is so clearly visible.**

* **being active every day makes it easier to hear the inner voice craving natural foods**

* > After 2X years, the feelings I had about running 26 miles is now the same as back then.

* > **My basic rule for training: never take 2 days off in a row – if you carefully increase the load, your muscles will take it; they'll comply if you show them the examples of the amount of work expected.**

* > **Running every day is a kind of lifeline for me. I only have a few reasons to keep on running, and a truckload of them to quit. All I can do is keep those few reasons nicely polished.**

* > **When I put my running shoes on in the morning, my feet are heavy and I can barely get them moving. As I keep on running, my muscles loosen up, and after ~20 minutes, I'm able to run normally. I start to speed up and I can run without problem.**

* > To deal with something unhealthy, a person needs to be as healthy as possible – that's my motto.

* competing against time isn't important; what's much more important is if I can finish with a feeling of contentment

* > **for me, the main goal of exercising is to maintain and improve my physical condition in order to keep writing novels – so if training cuts into writing time, this would be putting the cart before the horse**
