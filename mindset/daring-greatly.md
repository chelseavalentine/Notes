# Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead

### Ch 1: Sacrity â€“ Looking inside our culture of "Never Enough"

* considerable questions:
  1. What're the messages and expectations that define our culture, and how does culture influence our behaviors?
  2. How're our struggles and behaviors related to protecting ourselves?
  3. How are our behaviors, thoughts, and emotions related to vulnerability and the need for a strong sense of worthiness?
* shame: is self-worth tied to achievement, productivity, or compliance?
* comparison: is there constant overt/covert comparing and ranking? Are people held to a narrow standard rather than acknowledged for their unique gifts and contributions?
* disengagement: are people afraid to take risks and try new things? is it easier to stay quiet than share stories, experiences, and ideas?
* **showing up, taking risks, and letting myself be seen is enough**
  * I am enough
* perfectionism isn't self-improvement: at its core, it's vying for approval
* when you share something/before you do, ask yourself:
  1. why am I sharing this?
  2. what outcome am I hoping for?
  3. what emotions am I experiencing?
  4. do my intentions align with my values?
  5. is there an outcome/response/lack of response that'll hurt my feelings?
  6. is sharing this in the service of connection?
  7. am I genuinely asking the people in my life for what I need?
* greatest thread to creativity, innovation, and learning is disengagement
* Without feedback, there can't be transformative change; when we don't talk to people we're leading about their strengths and opportunities for growth, they begin to question their contributions and our commitment. Disengagement follows.
  * **feedback is a function of respect**
* **sometimes the bravest and most important thing you can do is just show up**
