# Principles: Life and Work

* typically, by doing what comes naturally to us, we fail to account for our weaknesses, which leads us to crash

* > **To do exceptionally well, you have to push your limits, and if you push your limits, you'll crash and it'll hurt a lot. You'll think you've failed – but it won't be true unless you give up. Believe it or not, your pain will fade and you'll have many other opportunities ahead of you, though you may not see them at the time. (p. 37)**

  * > The most important thing you can do is gather the lessons these failures provide and gain humility and radical open-mindedness in order to increase your chances of success. Then you press on.

* **But I need to have both low risk and high returns, and by setting out on a mission to discover how i could, I learned to go slowly when faced with the choice between two things that you need that are seemingly at odds. That way, you can figure out how to have as much of both as possible. There's always a path that you just haven't discovered yet, so look for it until you find it, rather than settle on the choice that is then apparent to you. (p. 38)**

* **be curious enough to want to understand how the people who see things differently from you come to see them that way**

* > The smallness of the company and openness of communication means that everyone is affected when one person is demotivated, treated badly, or not given due respect.

* > whether… continues to evolve quickly or falls prey to the forces of decline will depend on whether we keep doing the unique things

* the greatest success you can have as the person in charge is to orchestrate others to do things well without you

* >  they ranked low on 'concern for others', because when faced with a choice between achieving their goal  or pleasing (or not disappointing others), they'd choose achieving their goal every time

* > **A "hero" isn't a perfect person who always gets things right. Far from it. A hero is someone who found/achieved/did something beyond the normal range of achievement, and has given themself to something bigger or other than themselves.**

  * they overcome their fear of fighting because of determination to get what they want

* Instead of feeling frustrated or overwhelmed, I saw pain as nature's reminder that there's something important for me to learn.

* > **Look to the patterns of things that affect you in order to understand the cause-effect relationships that drive them and to learn principles for dealing with them effectively.**

## Life principles

#### 1. Embrace reality and deal with it.

* eventually you get past the pain of making mistakes and enjoy the pleasure of learning from them
* an accurate understanding of reality is an essential foundation for any good outcome
  * fighting seeing what's true when it's not what you want it to be => not effective
  * **don't get hung up on how things "should be" because you'll miss out on learning about how things really are**
* we're simultaneously everything and nothing
* in order to gain strength, it's physically and emotionally hard (e.g. shame, frustration, mental struggle, embarrassment)
  * **Pain + Reflection = Progress**
* upon confronting pain, you can choose a healthy painful truth, or a comfortable unhealthy decision
  * **the pain is the signal!**
* weigh second-order and third-order consequences of your actions
  * otherwise you make big mistakes in decision-making

#### 2. Use this 5-Step process to get what you want out of life

* You should be doing one of these steps at a time, discretely.

[1] Have clear goals:

* choose a goal (gotta reject things you want for the best things)
* **don't confuse goals with desires (and reconcile your goals and desires)**
* **never rule out a goal because you think it's unattainable**
  * **attainability is a function of what you know right now**
* almost nothing can stop you from succeeding if you have [1] flexibility, and [2] self-accountability

[2] Identify and don't tolerate problems:

* painful problems = potential problems screaming at you
* **don't avoid confronting problems because they're rooted in harsh realities that are unpleasant to look at**
  * **when a problem stems from your lack of talent/skill, you could feel shame, but get over it**
  * **acknowledging your weaknesses isn't the same as surrendering to them**

[3] Diagnose problems to get at their root causes

* focus on "what is" before deciding what to do about it

[4] Design a plan

* sketch out the plan broadly and then go into actionable items

[5] Push through to completion

* establish clear metrics to ensure that you're following your plan

#### 3. Be radically open-minded

* you need to stop being too preoccupied with telling people what you think is correct, and figure out their perspective; don't presume too much
* radical open-mindedness is motivated by the genuine worry that you may not be seeing all of the choices
* **don't worry about looking good; worry about achieving your goal**
* **plan for the worst-case scenario, and make it as good as possible**
* **it's not an argument, it's the exploration of what's true**

#### 5. Make decisions effectively

* make sure people you ask questions of are fully informed and believable

  * listening to uninformed people is worse than no answers at all

* > **If you fail to make the unconscious conscious, it'll rule your life and you'll call it fate.**

* **you need to evaluate the marginal benefit of getting more information against the marginal cost of waiting to decide**

* **use principles**

  * **show your thinking down so you can note the criteria you're using to make your decision**

* **understand how to manage pain to produce progress**

## Work principles

* if people feel their lives and work are aligned, they'll treat them harmoniously, rather than working for conflicting goals
* bringing everything to the service will [1] remove the need to try to look good, and [2] eliminates the time required to guess what people are thinking
* as much as possible, work should be what you do to achieve your mission

#### 1. Trust in radical truth and transparency

* being radically truthful and transparent with colleagues and expecting them to be the same with you ensures that important issues are apparent instead of hidden

#### 2. Cultivate meaningful work and relationships

#### 3. Create a culture in which it's okay to make mistakes and unacceptable not to learn from them

#### 4. Get and stay in sync

* spend lavishly on the time and energy you devote to getting in sync, because it's the best investment you can make
* **make sure you're getting the other's message; start by assuming you're either not communicating or listening well instead of blaming the other party**
* **achieve completion in conversations**

#### 5. Believability-weight your decision-making

#### 6. Recognize how to get beyond disagreements

* **make sure people don't confuse the right to complain, give advice, and openly debate, with the right to make decisions**

* > **Don't let the little things divide you when your agreement on the big things should bind you.**

#### 7. Remember that the "who" is more important than the "what"

#### 8. Hire right, because the penalties for hiring wrong are huge

#### 9. Consistently train, test, evaluate, and sort people

#### 10. Manage as someone operating a machine to achieve a goal

* understand the differences between managing, micromanaging, and not managing

#### 11. Perceive and don't tolerate problems

#### 12. Diagnose problems to get at their root causes

* Managers usually fall short of their goals for one or more reasons:
  1. they're too distant
  2. **they have problems perceiving quality**
  3. they've lost sight of how bad things have become because they've gotten use to it
  4. **they have such high pride in their work (or such large egos) that they can't bear to admit that they can't solve their own problems**
  5. they fear adverse consequences for admitting failure

* How to drill down to the root cause of problems:
  1. Inventory all of the core problems, specifically:
     1. have the involved/relevant people involved in the drill down
        1. you get their insights and better ownership of the situation
     2. don't focus on rare events or trivial problems
     3. don't try to find solutions yet
  2. Identify proximate causes down to root causes by asking "why?"
  3. Create a plan, separate from the group, which addresses the root causes
  4. Execute the agreed-on plan and report progress at least monthly

#### 13. Design improvements to your machine to get around problems

* remember: a good machine takes into account the fact that people are imperfect

#### 14. Do what you set out to do

* > **Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.**

* **allow time for rest and renovation with regular scheduled downtime**

#### 15. Use tools and protocols to shape how work is done

#### 16. Don't overlook governance

* make sure that no one is more powerful than the system, nor so important that they're irreplaceable
