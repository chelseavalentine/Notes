# The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck

### Ch 1: Don't try

* > The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience.

* when you care _less_ about something, you may do better at it

* pursuing the negative generates the positive (e.g. pain from working out)

* finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy

* **when we believe that it isn't ok for things to suck sometimes, then we unconsciously start blaming ourselves**

### Ch 2: Happiness is a problem

* happiness isn't a solvable equation; dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature and are necessary components to creating happiness

  * we suffer because it is biologically useful; it's natures preferred agent for inspiring change

* > to be happy, we need something to solve; happiness is therefore a form of action; it's an activity, not something that's passively bestowed upon you

* **Negative emotions are a call-to-action. When you feel them, it's because you're supposed to do something.**

* **What pain do you want in your life? What're you willing to struggle for?**

  * this seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out

  * > not many people want to suffer through sixty-hour workweeks and arbitrary corporate hierarchies to escape the confines...

### Ch 3: You are not special

* > **The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they're exceptional; they become amazing because they're obsessed with improvement. And that obsession with improvement stems from an unerring belief that they are, in fact, not that great at all. It's anti-entitlement.**

### Ch 4: The value of suffering

* the problem with overvaluing material success is the danger of prioritizing it over other values, such as honestly, nonviolence, and compassion
* denying negative emotions leads to experiencing deeper and more prolonged negative emotions and to emotional dysfunction
  * **when we deny our problems, we rob ourselves of the chance to solve them and generate happiness**

### Ch 5: You are always choosing

* a lot of people hesitate to take responsibility for their problems because they believe that to be _responsible_ for their problems is to also be _at fault_ for them
* if the people in your relationships are selfish and doing hurtful things, it's likely you are too, you just don't realize it

### Ch 6: You're wrong about everything

* **the more something threatens your identity, the more you'll avoid it**

  * In other words: the more something threatens to change how you view yourself, how successful/unsuccessful you believe yourself to be, how well you see yourself living up to your values, the more you will avoid ever getting around to doing it

* **your idea of who "you" are is an arbitrary mental construction; the arbitrary metrics by which you define yourself actually trap you, and thus you're better off letting go of everything**

* > **When you assume that your plane is the one that's going to crash, or that your project idea is the stupid one that everyone is going to laugh at, or that you're the one everyone's going to choose to mock or ignore, you're implicitly telling yourself, "I'm the exception; I'm unlike everybody else; I'm different and special."**

* a good question to ask yourself: Would being wrong create a better or worse problem than my current problem?

* if it feels like you vs. the world, chances are it's really just you vs. yourself.

### Ch 7: Failure is the way forward

* we all have areas of our lives where we sit and wonder "But _how_?" when really it's as simple as just doing it
