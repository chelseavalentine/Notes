# The No Asshole Rule

### Ch 1: What workplace assholes do and why you know so many

* two tests to spot whether someone is acting like an asshole
  1. after speaking to the asshole, does the target feel oppressed, humiliated, de-energized, or belittled by the person? Does the target feel worse about his/herself?
  2. Does the asshole aim their venom at people who are less powerful, rather than at those who are more powerful?

#### Don't replace assholes with wimps and polite clones

* constructive arguments over ideas drive greater performance, especially when teams do non-routine work
  - when teams engage in conflict over ideas in mutual respect, they develop ideas and perform better

### Ch 2: The Damage Done: Why Every Workplace Needs the Rule

* extreme public humiliation is more dramatic/memorable, but tiny indignities take their toll throughout the day
* bullies drive witnesses & bystanders out of their jobs, just as they do to firsthand victims
* assholes also suffer because even when they do their jobs well by other standards, they get fired
* questionnaires in a study found that working units with the best leadership and coworker relationships reported the most errors (~ 10x more) because of psychological safety
* when people feel mistreated or dissatisfied with their jobs, they're unwilling to do extra work to help their orgs

### Ch 3: How to implement the rule, enforce it, and keep it alive

* be unapologetically intolerant of anyone who refuses to show respect for those around them
* > employees should respect and support each other even if they don't like each other
* Intel's preached culture: the only thing worse than too much confrontation is no confrontation at all
* How to enforce the no asshole rule
  * treat certified assholes as incompetent employees
  * manage moments - not just practices, policies, and systems: i.e. focusing on and challenging the small things that people do and watching how people respond

### Ch 4: How to stop your "inner jerk" from getting out

* when people catch unpleasant expressions from others (e.g. frowning/glaring), it makes them feel grumpier and angrier subconsciously
* when you get a job offer, look at the people you'd be working with (are they self-centered, nasty, narrow-minded, unethical, overworked, physically ill, etc.?)
* seeing coworkers as rivals and enemies is a dangerous game

### Ch 5: When assholes reign: Tips for survivng nasty people and workpalces

* reframe the nastiness
* avoid internalization, i.e. "I will never get over this", "I must have done something wrong for this to happen to me", & "Everyone hates me", etc. 
* happiness reflects the difference between what you expect vs. what you actually get in life
* sometimes the best thing for your mental health is to not care about your job, company, or nasty people
* find and build pockets of people/places where you can hide from assholes/hang out with decent people
  * don't let these outlets turn into a "woe is me" session full of powerlessness

### Ch 6: The virtues of assholes

* > it can help create a sense of "alarm" and a "feeling of urgency"
* first blind spot of assholes who succeed regardless: they erroneously conclude that their nastiness is crucial to their success
* second blindspot of assholes who succeed: confusing the tactics that helped them gain power with the tactics that are best for leading a team or company
* victims avoid assholes' wraths by reporting only the good news, which feeds assholes' delusions of effectiveness

### Ch 7: The No Asshole Rule as a way of life

* negative interactions have 5x the effect on mood than positive interactions
* the rule lives or dies in the little moments
* everyone takes responsibility for expelling assholes from the system

### Epilogue

* long-term studies of close personal relationships show that positive interactions need to outweigh the negative ones by at least 5 to 1, otherwise the relationship is likely to fail
