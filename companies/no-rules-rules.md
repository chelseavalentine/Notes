# No Rules Rules
Notes on _No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention_ by Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer.

**Recommendation?:** Overall, it's a good book to read to learn a little bit more about feedback. I mainly read it to have an artificial light at the end of a tunnel, if you know what I mean. I'm not sure whether it's an absolutely necessary read, and would probably recommend it alongside watching all four seasons of Aggretsuko in one weekend to to relieve workplace stress.

## Chapter 1: A great workplace is stunning colleagues

* if you have a team of 5 stunning employees and two adequate ones, the adequate ones will:
	* sap manager's energy to have less time for top performers
	* reduce the quality of group discussions, lowering the team's overall IQ
	* force others to develop ways to work around them, reducing efficiency
	* drive staff who seek excellence to quit
	* show the team that you accept mediocrity, thus multiplying the problem

## Chapter 2: Say what you really think (with positive intent)

* receiving feedback in front of a group sends off danger alarms in the human brain
	* the brain is constantly on watch for signs of group rejection, which back in more primitive times, would have led to isolation and potentially death
* your behavior when you're getting the feedback is a critical factor; you need to show that it's safe to give feedback by responding to all criticism with gratitude and by providing "belonging cues"
	* belonging cue: a small gesture, e.g. using an appreciative tone of voice, moving closer to the speaker, or looking positively into that person's eyes; or a larger gesture like thanking the person for their courage or recognizing them for their courage publicly

## Chapter 5: Open the Books

* the pratfall effect: the tendency for someone's appeal to increase or decrease after making a mistake, depending on their perceived ability to perform well in general
	* you'll want to build trust in your competency before shouting your mistakes
