# The Person You Mean To Be: How Good People Fight Bias

This is so poorly written. It reads like a college freshman's term paper. The author throws in random facts with some dramatized writing, portraying the book as so #deep.

I expected this to be more dry and factual, giving you a chance to think about how things apply in your world, however, the book is much closer to being a diary entry about the author's take on biases and social issues.

If those were the only issues, maybe the book would still be worthy of a skim to completion. But unfortunately, then the author wrote pages on the extremely trite "growth mindset."

If I were the type to regret things that don't really matter, I would regret buying this book. There have got to be better resources to help you examine biases; what a shame.
