# Lovability
Notes on _How to Build a Business That People Love and Be Happy Doing It_ by Brian de Haaff.

**Recommendation?**: Hell yeah. I've experienced that a lot of this book rings true. It's well-written, so a lot of the anecdotes aren't really necessary to grasp the concepts. This book gave me hope that having integrity, being caring, and doing things thoroughly can be sustainable, viable, or even preferable approach.

## Introduction

* **lovability:** the capacity to earn genuine, heartfelt love and loyalty from customers, leading to sustainable happiness for everyone involved

## Ch 1: What is a product?

* the complete product experience:
	* **marketing:** how potential customers learn about the product & decide it might be a fit to help solve their problem (e.g. social platforms, online reviews, company-published content)
	* **sales:** prospects learning about the product from a company representative
	* **technology:** the features customers pay for
	* **supporting systems:** what makes it possible to deliver the product; the customer may rarely see it but it has a huge impact (e.g. billing, provisioning, analytics, customer support, etc.)
	* **third-party integrations:** fits into how the customer already lives
	* **customer support/service**
	* **policies:** rules to govern how business is done
* the customer's journey has 3 key phases: motivation, education, & adoption
* data isn't enough, you must also understand why and have empathy for customers
* values/principals – What does your product represent? What does your company stand for? What will you always do and never do? What do you care about?
* what is the purpose of your product?
	* if your product is shallow, your customer relationships will be, too

## Ch 2: Pursuing love

* Six traps of innovation
	1. **Technology first** – being so focused on software or hardware as the solution to everything that they don't understand who their customers are or the product they're building
	2. **No team to execute** on vision
	3. **No clear goals**, pursuing everything
	4. **Death by a thousand cuts** – progress is slowed by infighting, fear, lack of strategy, general paralysis, etc.
	5. **Pivot** – believing you can just pivot your way to customer delight, rather than also looking at execution failures and so on
	6. **Spin doctoring** – focusing on the perception that you're delivering delight rather than actually making it so; a.k.a. being delusional AF hype-person
* problems with teams that rush straight to obtaining funding after an idea: with investors looking over your shoulder, you don't have the time to build a superlative product so you manage perceptions instead !

## Ch 3: The 10 building blocks of lovability

1. **Hope** – the customer thinks they found something that'll solve their problem
2. **Satisfaction** – customer tries product and it makes their life better
3. **Care** – customer gets support when they need it
4. **Confidence** – customer can depend on the company to solve their problems or answer questions
5. **Trust** – customer believes they're cared about
6. **Scale** – customer trusts the product will get better alongside them/anticipate their needs
7. **Sustainability** – customer believes that the company will be there in the future, providing similarly great value
8. **Motivation** – customer feels the product helps them be better than they are without it (capabilities, information, inspiration, etc.)
9. **Fun** – product is enjoyable to use
10. **Halo** – the product makes the customer look better

## Ch 4: The benefits of being loved

* sustainability comes from synergy between the personal and professional parts of each employee's life
* appreciation isn't just about praise, it's about the opportunity to rise based on your effort & accomplishments
