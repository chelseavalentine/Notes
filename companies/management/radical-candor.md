# Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity

### Understand what motivates each person on your team

* you need to understand how each person's job fits into their life goals
* success of a team depends both on the "rock" stars and "super" stars
  * rockstars = rocks of your team who've found their groove and are interested in going deep into their craft; backbone of a strong team
  * superstars = people who need to be challenged and given new opportunities to grow constantly
* think about: if someone is described as "ambitious," then do you have a positive or negative reaction? if you say someone is "stable," do you assume that this person is going nowhere?
  * pushing everyone to go super-fast isn't "best practice" for building a high-performing team
    * "potential" category doesn't leave positive impression for people  who were great at what they did and wanted to keep doing it
  * what growth trajectory does each person on my team _want_ to be on right now?
    * shouldn't put permanent labels on people even after finding out
* performance isn't a permanent label: no person is an excellent performer; they just performed excellently last quarter
* **"steep growth" is generally characterized by rapid change (learning new skills/deepening existing ones quickly) – it's not about becoming a manager**
  * shouldn't be thought of narrowly as a promotion; it's about increased impact over time
* some roles are better suited to rockstars b/c they require steadiness, accumulated knowledge, and attention to detail that others may not have
* shouldn't assume people's growth trajectories because they can shift with life phases/events
* don't insincerely describe a job in lofty terms; your job isn't to provide purpose; instead it's to get to know your direct reports well enough to understand how each derives meaning from their work
* **top mistake: ignoring people who're doing the best work because "they don't need me" or "I don't want to micromanage"**
  * hiring the right people and then leaving them alone is stupid; imagine doing that with marriage
* need to give fair performance ratings
  * Often rockstars don't get the performance reviews they deserve because top ratings are reserved for people in line for promotion
* worst: companies hiring people for training who they'd never hire to do the job, OR instead of firing people who aren't performing well, sending them to teach others how to do the role
* people on a gradual growth trajectory are often pejoratively referred to as "B-players" or having "capped out"
* for superstars:
  * keep them challenged (& figure out who'll replace them when they move on)
  * give them more work, even when it seems like it's more than what's feasible for one person to do
    * find them mentors from outside your team/org.: people who can offer more
    * don't get too dependent on them, think of them like shooting stars
* **potential ≠ leadership potential**
* an unpopular, but a thing to encourage 100% exceptional work, was to give people who hadn't done exceptional work in 2 years the ability to shine by giving them the opportunity to work on a project
  * if they weren't exceptional then, they were encouraged to find a new job
* how do you know when to fire?
  * have you given radically candid guidance?
  * do you understand the impact of their performance on their colleagues?
    * by the time it has come to your attention, it has been driving peers crazy for a long time
  * have you saught advice from others?
* **common lies managers tell themselves to avoid firing:**
  * it will get better
    * how exactly will it get better? what will you do differently? them? even if things get better, will they have improved enough?
  * somebody is better than nobody
    * it's better to have a hole than an asshole
    * poor performers create extra work for others because they leave parts of their job undone, do other parts sloppily, or behave unprofessionally in a way others must compensate for
  * a transfer is the answer
  * it's bad for morale
* quarter ratings that don't personalize: "off quarter", "solid quarter", and "exceptional quarter"

### Drive results collaboratively

* there's a difference between always _being_ right and always _getting it_ right

* strong opinions, weakly held

* one big idea is pretty easy to copy, but thousands of tweaks are impossible to see from the outside, let alone imitate

* important to get people to clarify their thinking so you don't squash their best thinking/ignore problems that are bothering them

* don't grab a decision just because a debate has gotten painful

* > When facts change, I change my mind.

### An approach to establishing trust with your direct reports

* > don't think of work-life balance as some zero-sum game where everything you put into your work robs your life and vice versa; think of it as work-life integration

* **if they aren't used to guidance, ask for permission to give it: say something like "would it be helpful if I told you what I thought of X?" if your boss says no, or that's not your job, then let it drop and polish your resumé**

  * if they react badly, try again, but if that doesn't work, it may be time to move on; you deserve a better boss

* self-abnegation (the denial/abasement of oneself) is never an effective way to show you care

### Techniques for avoiding burnout and boredom

* remember that the reason you're firing is not because they suck, or because they suck at this job; it's that the job you gave them sucks for them
* when it's all done, acknowledge how hard these convos were and plan for some sort of clear-the-air activity

### Results: things you can do to get things done together

* on feedback's structure:
  1. the situation you saw
  2. the behavior you observed
  3. the impact you observed
