# Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity

* the effects of accepting mediocrity to be kind are:
  * others start wondering why you accept such poor work
  * exceptional people start getting sloppy and missing key deadlines
  * others wonder whether you know the difference between great and mediocre
    * don't know if you can appreciate the quality of their work
* lack of guidance => a dysfunctional team that gets poor results
  * productive, but extremely direct, feedback is key!
* approach to giving criticism: do it in a way that doesn't call into question your confidence in their abilities, but doesn't leave too much room for interpretation
* the war for talent is so intense that there's no need to pay "the asshole tax"

## A new management philosophy

* emotional labor isn't just part of the job, it's key to being a good boss

* most important thing: developing a trusting relationship with all direct reports

* 3 responsibilities as a manager

  1. create a culture of guidance (praise & criticism)
  2. understand what motivates each person on your team well enough to avoid burnout/boredom and keep the team cohesive
  3. drive results collaboratively

* the desire to "keep it professional" denies something essential to getting people to "care personally"

  * we become alienated when we must suppress who we are to earn a living

* being a boss is a job, not a value judgment

* What does it mean to care personally?

  * acknowledging that we're all people with lives and aspirations
  * learning what's important to people
  * sharing what helps you get out of bed and what has the opposite effect

* you have to encourage people to challenge you directly enough that you may be the one who feels upset or angry

* it's not radical candor if you don't show that you care personally

* you need to look at people in the eyes to convey the full sincerity of your words, more so when they believe the opposite to be true

* don't let a positive result get in the way of telling someone something they need to fix

  * also don't personalize feedback (criticism) to be a personality trait

* > It's not mean, it's clear

* **radically candid praise:** "I admire that about you" but you must say why and be specific for it to be sincere

* fundamental human decency is something every person owes every other, regardless of position

* **belittling compliments:** making people feel like they got fucked over even though you're complimenting their effort

  * a.k.a. backhanded compliments

* **manipulative insincerity:** when you don't care enough about a person to challenge them directly

  * occurs when: you're too concerned with being liked; you think you can gain a political advantage by being fake; or when you're too tired to argue anymore
  * when you're overly worried about how people will perceive you, you're less willing to say what needs to be said
    * give a damn about other people, but don't worry about whether they give a damn about you

* **manipulative insincere praise:** reversing your intellectual position in order to keep your job, or in fear of losing something

* when bosses are too invested in everyone getting along, they fail to encourage people on their teams to criticize one another for fear of sowing discord

* **be as specific and thorough with praise as you are with criticism**

  * Who did what? Why was it so great?

* **the worst thing is to say silent because you want to spare yourself**

## Understand what motivates each person on your team

* you need to understand how each person's job fits into their life goals
* success of a team depends both on the "rock" stars and "super" stars
  * rockstars = rocks of your team who've found their groove and are interested in going deep into their craft; backbone of a strong team
  * superstars = people who need to be challenged and given new opportunities to grow constantly
* think about: if someone is described as "ambitious," then do you have a positive or negative reaction? if you say someone is "stable," do you assume that this person is going nowhere?
  * pushing everyone to go super-fast isn't "best practice" for building a high-performing team
    * "potential" category doesn't leave positive impression for people  who were great at what they did and wanted to keep doing it
  * what growth trajectory does each person on my team _want_ to be on right now?
    * shouldn't put permanent labels on people even after finding out
* performance isn't a permanent label: no person is an excellent performer; they just performed excellently last quarter
* **"steep growth" is generally characterized by rapid change (learning new skills/deepening existing ones quickly) – it's not about becoming a manager**
  * shouldn't be thought of narrowly as a promotion; it's about increased impact over time
* some roles are better suited to rockstars b/c they require steadiness, accumulated knowledge, and attention to detail that others may not have
* shouldn't assume people's growth trajectories because they can shift with life phases/events
* don't insincerely describe a job in lofty terms; your job isn't to provide purpose; instead it's to get to know your direct reports well enough to understand how each derives meaning from their work
* **top mistake: ignoring people who're doing the best work because "they don't need me" or "I don't want to micromanage"**
  * hiring the right people and then leaving them alone is stupid; imagine doing that with marriage
* need to give fair performance ratings
  * Often rockstars don't get the performance reviews they deserve because top ratings are reserved for people in line for promotion
* worst: companies hiring people for training who they'd never hire to do the job, OR instead of firing people who aren't performing well, sending them to teach others how to do the role
* people on a gradual growth trajectory are often pejoratively referred to as "B-players" or having "capped out"
* for superstars:
  * keep them challenged (& figure out who'll replace them when they move on)
  * give them more work, even when it seems like it's more than what's feasible for one person to do
    * find them mentors from outside your team/org.: people who can offer more
    * don't get too dependent on them, think of them like shooting stars
* **potential ≠ leadership potential**
* an unpopular, but a thing to encourage 100% exceptional work, was to give people who hadn't done exceptional work in 2 years the ability to shine by giving them the opportunity to work on a project
  * if they weren't exceptional then, they were encouraged to find a new job
* how do you know when to fire?
  * have you given radically candid guidance?
  * do you understand the impact of their performance on their colleagues?
    * by the time it has come to your attention, it has been driving peers crazy for a long time
  * have you saught advice from others?
* **common lies managers tell themselves to avoid firing:**
  * it will get better
    * how exactly will it get better? what will you do differently? them? even if things get better, will they have improved enough?
  * somebody is better than nobody
    * it's better to have a hole than an asshole
    * poor performers create extra work for others because they leave parts of their job undone, do other parts sloppily, or behave unprofessionally in a way others must compensate for
  * a transfer is the answer
  * it's bad for morale
* quarter ratings that don't personalize: "off quarter", "solid quarter", and "exceptional quarter"

## Drive results collaboratively

* there's a difference between always _being_ right and always _getting it_ right

* strong opinions, weakly held

* one big idea is pretty easy to copy, but thousands of tweaks are impossible to see from the outside, let alone imitate

* important to get people to clarify their thinking so you don't squash their best thinking/ignore problems that are bothering them

* don't grab a decision just because a debate has gotten painful

* > When facts change, I change my mind.

## An approach to establishing trust with your direct reports

* > don't think of work-life balance as some zero-sum game where everything you put into your work robs your life and vice versa; think of it as work-life integration

* **if they aren't used to guidance, ask for permission to give it: say something like "would it be helpful if I told you what I thought of X?" if your boss says no, or that's not your job, then let it drop and polish your resumé**

  * if they react badly, try again, but if that doesn't work, it may be time to move on; you deserve a better boss

* self-abnegation (the denial/abasement of oneself) is never an effective way to show you care

## Techniques for avoiding burnout and boredom

* remember that the reason you're firing is not because they suck, or because they suck at this job; it's that the job you gave them sucks for them
* when it's all done, acknowledge how hard these convos were and plan for some sort of clear-the-air activity

## Results: things you can do to get things done together

* on feedback's structure:
  1. the situation you saw
  2. the behavior you observed
  3. the impact you observed
