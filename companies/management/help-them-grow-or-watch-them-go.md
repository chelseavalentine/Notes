# Help Them Grow or Watch Them Go: Career Conversations Organizations Need and Employees Want

### Ch 2: Can we talk?

* having conversations to inspire reflection and commitment in others can be more impactful than orchestrating assignments
  * ask questions instead of doing all the talking so that they can take ownership
  * don't immediately volunteer resolutions or provide most of the elements of someone else's development plan
* you don't need to have all the answers! you just need to be able to ask good questions

### Ch 3: Let hindsight lead the way

* should have a view of:
  * strengths and skills (what they're good at)
  * values (what's most important)
  * weaknesses (what they struggle with)
  * interests (what keeps them engaged)
  * dislikes (what they want to steer clear of)
  * preferences (how they'd like to work)
* questions:
  * what do you wish you had more time for?
  * what bores you?/what takes routinely get pushed to the bottom of your to-do list?

### Ch 4: Feed me

* ABC
  * Abilities
    * What are my greatest strengths?
    * Which of my skills are most valuable?
    * What can you always count on me for?
    * What value do I bring?
  * Blind spots
    * What behaviors have you observed that might get in my way?
    * How have I fallen short of expectations?
    * How might my strengths work against me?
  * Conditions
    * In what settings/circumstances do I make the greatest contributions?
    * Under what conditions have you noticed me struggling?
