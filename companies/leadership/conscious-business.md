# Conscious Business: How to Build Value through Values

### Introduction

* > **No matter how comprehensive, don't confuse a map with the territory itself.**

* > **Whatever you have to say, leave the roots on, let them dangle. And the dirt, just to make it clear where they came from.**

* everyone receives tranquilizing information while leaders trumpet the importance of "positive thinking" and "being a team player" – it seems like we're winning until the last possible moment, when it's announced that the project failed.

### Ch 1: Conscious business

* > **people are unpredictable: you apply a certain amount of pressure and head, and you never know what's going to happen**

* to be unconscious is to be asleep, mindless – to be driven by habitual patterns and instincts

  * >It causes is to do things that don't serve us. To pursue goals that aren't conducive to our health and happiness, and to act in ways we'll later regret. We produce results that hurt us and those we care about.

### Ch 2: Unconditional responsibility

* **see yourself as a player – a central person who contributed to the current situation; a player is in the game and can contribute to the result; a victim can only suffer the consequences of others' actions**

  * **"reponse-ability":** your ability to respond to a situation; looking at your cards and playing them to the best of your ability

* **the only way to improve your situation is to take responsibility to protect yourself, to stop expecting rulers to change; to do what you can, given they wouldn't**

* we learn that responsibility is synonymous with guilt, and therefore should be avoided

* > **If you're the one suffering, then you're the one who has the problem. That means you're the one to take corrective action. If you expect the ones who made the decision that suited *their* needs to solve *your* problem, then good luck.**

  * **since the victim can't see himself as part of the problem, he can't imagine himself as part of the solution**
    * **the price of innocence is powerlessness**

* player's language includes words like "I", and addresses specific changes that you could've taken and can currently take

* providing moral support to a victim can be unhelpful if you focus on what was done to them

### Ch 3: Essential integrity

* **it's dangerous to see yourself as a sole creator of results that depend on external circumstances**

  * assuming responsibility can create as much harm as avoiding responsibility for your behavior

* evaluate progress by comparing the intended vs. the real outcomes, and the alignment between behavior and values

* > **It does a person far less harm to suffer injustice than to commit it.**

* discipline = capacity to maintain awareness and choose consciously in the face of instinctual pressures

* > **Myopic lust for winning the battle creates a strategic blindness that can lose the war.**

  * **game theory: to win the game, you need to be willing not to win the subgames; if you try to win the subgames, you'll lose sight of the goal and probably lose the game**

* **there're no guaranteed external rewards for behaving ethically; the only guarantee is in being proud of who you are**

### Ch 4: Ontological humility

* > **We do not see things as they are, we see things as we are.**

* **ontological arrogance:** the belief that your perspective is privileged, that yours is the only way to interpret the situation

  * **ontological humility:** the acknowledgement that you don't have special claim on reality/truth, that others have equally valid perspectives deserving respect and consideration
  * the belief that others are criticizing you if they disagree with your opinions can only occur if you don't distinguish your identity from your opinions

* > In unilateral control environments, people are defensive, inconsistent, controlling, and manipulative. They're guarded and fearful, seeking to band with "allies" in opposition to "enemies." They withhold relevant information, thoughts, and feelings. This leads to hypocritical relationships and repressed conflicts that surface as underhanded political manuevering. Periodically, public outbursts destroy the façade of peace and harmony. These emotional explosions are so counterproductive that they reinforce everybody's beliefs that they need to avoid all open confrontations, which leads to even more repression and covert power games.

  * **people respond with rebelliousness or submission to those that manipulate them**
  * Without even thinking about it, controllers suppress information contradicting their mental model; they operate with the unilateral control model without realizing it. They spend their days manipulating others while considering themselves open and curious.
    * the basic premise is to act as though you aren't unilaterally trying to control others; when this duplicitousness takes over the culture, the organization goes crazy

* **The fundamental trigger for the organization's defensive routine isn't the contradiction but its undiscussability. To deactivate it, it must become discussable.**

* to express your opinions, you can use sentences such as: "I think that X is Y" or "X is Y for me"

  * **any opinion is toxic when it masquerades as fact**

  * > Some people think there's value in being brutally honest, but toxic opinions always turn out to be more brutal than honest. Sharing these opinions destroys efficiency, hurts relationships, and creates animosity.

    * to fully own your opinions, you need to change your speech AND thinking to realize *why* you disagree

### Ch 5: Authentic communication

* > **We see ourselves primarily in the light of our intentions, which are invisible to others, while we see others primarily in the light of their actions, which are visible to us.**

* **when we feel that we're threatened, we fall into polarized thinking, an all-or-nothing logic that assumes we're totally competent or incompetent, totally good or bad, totally worthy or unworthy — without any middle ground**

* **Life is a continuous flow: you're not a thing, which is why labels are constricting and highly inaccurate. Abstract labels such as "worthless", "inferior", "worthy", or "superior" communicate nothing and mean nothing**

* productive conversations involve two-way inquiries and learning into the impact of and reasoning behind actions

* > **Whenever you're offered two equally bad alternatives, choose the third option**

* 5 mutual learning purposes in difficult conversations:

  1. learning their story
  2. expressing your views and feelings
  3. addressing the situation together
  4. creating a respectful context for the conversation
  5. ensure that you have a proper place/setting for the conversation

* ensure comprehension before moving on

  * "Does this make sense?"
  * "Can I clarify anything further?"
  * "What do you think about this?"
  * "Do you see any gaps in my reasoning?"
  * "Did you reach a different conclusion?"
  * "Have I addressed your concerns?"
  * "Can you think of other ways of looking at the problem?"

* **Accept challenges. When you encourage feedback, you'll get challenges. Alternate views don't weaken their argument, they reorient you from unilateral control towards mutual learning.**

  * humility doesn't mean giving up your point of view, it means exploring the situation together

* **the less the other person feels received and appreciated, the less willing they'll be to engage in a productive discussion**

  * > **I don't care about how much you know until I know how much you care.**

* summarize by detoxifying their opinion, to encourage the person to take ownership of their opinions

  * acknowledge that you find the other person's feelings reasonable and that they matter to you

* don't prosecute: use open-ended questions that promote expression

* **Ask for permission to counter; make sure they've finished expressing their opinion!**

### Ch 6: Constructive negotiation

* > majority rule is 4 wolves and 1 sheep deciding what's for dinner

  * in matters of conscience, the law of majority has no place

* **we get very attached to our thoughts, rather than considering ourselves the free thinkers of such thoughts**

* focus on the interest (the desire or need at the root of the position)

  * why is X important to you?

### Ch 7: Impeccable coordination

* a culture of lone rangers (where the most competent one is the one who asks for the least help) leads to people hiding problems until it's too late to solve them, then trying to blame external circumstances
* well-formed request: "In order to accomplish X (the satisfaction of a need), I ask you to do Y (a specific action) by Z (a specific time). Can you commit to that?"
* **Impeccability in commitments is an unconditional discipline; it doesn't depend on others. You behave impeccably because it's the way you want to live.**
* **effective recognition isn't imposing; you tell the other person how they affected you instead of who they are**

### Ch 8: Emotional mastery

* judging yourself for emotions is like judging yourself for being cold or tired

* to move from self-inquiry to self-expression, ask questions to articulate the story behind the emotion
* **every time we block an emotion, we incur an emotional debt, which sooner or later, we have to pay – with high interest**
* use this formula to help you take responsibility, avoiding the "you make me feel" mistake:
  * **"I feel A when B, because I think C. Does this make sense to you?"**
  * (Listen and acknowledge.)
  * **"What I'd like is D, so I want to ask you E."**
* **when people fall prey to confusion and assume that their thoughts are emotions, they close off rational inquiry**

* confusion is magnified when people consider their emotions to be supporting evidence for their opinions
* **"would" opens a conversation, while "should" closes it**
* without forgiveness, anger becomes resentment and guilt, which becomes shame
  * **forgiveness isn't about absolving bad behavior or approving or condoning actions that fail to meet your standards**
  * **forgiveness doesn't exclude demanding compensation or taking corrective action – you can even sever the relationship**
  * **forgiveness isn't pretending that everything is alright when it isn't**
  * forgiveness isn't adopting a holier-than-thou attitude or doing others a favor – if you forgive out of a sense of superiority, that's arrogance
* **when we feel resentful, we feel the pain of the past again and again**

### Ch 9: Entering the market with helping hands

* it's impossible to suffer a loss when you love your opponent

* fulfilling work = an environment where people feel respected, listened to, valued, supported, and entrusted with meaningful and challenging work

* the only way to pursue happiness is not to pursue it directly; it arises from pursuing integrity and meaning

  * > **Happiness can't be attained by wanting to be happy – it must come as the unintended consequence of working for a goal greater than oneself.**

* > If this were the last five minutes of your life, is this the way you would want to spend them?

* **Take a step and trust that your new position will reveal a path that is invisible right now. If you can't find anything, fall back on the harness and try again**
