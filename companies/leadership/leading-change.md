# Leading Change

### Ch 1: Transforming organizations â€“ Why firms fail

#### Error 1: Allowing too much complacency

1. Allowing too much complacency
   1. too much past success, a lack of visible crises, low performance standards, insufficient feedback from external constituencies, and more all add up to: "Yes, we have our problems, but they aren't terrible and I'm doing my job just fine"
      - without a sense of urgency, people won't give the extra effort that's often essential, nor make the needed sacrifices
2. Failing to create a sufficiently powerful guiding coalition
3. Underestimating the power of vision
4. Under-communicating the vision by a factor of 10, 100, or 1,000
5. Permitting obstacles to block the new vision
6. Failing to create short-term wins
7. Declaring victory too soon
8. Neglecting to anchor changes firmly in the corporate culture

### Ch 2: Successful change and the force that drives it

* management is a set of processes that can keep a complicated system of people and technology running smoothly
* leadership defines what the future should look like, aligns people with that vision, and inspires them to make it happen despite the obstacles

### Ch 3: Establishing a sense of urgency

* sources of complacency:
  * too many visible resources
  * the absence of a major and visible crisis
  * a kill-the-messenger-of-bad-news, low-candor, low-confrontation culture
  * lack of sufficient performance feedback from external sources
* increasing urgency demands that you remove sources of complacency or minimize their impact: setting higher standards formally in the planning process and informally in day-to-day interaction

* > we don't see these kinds of bold moves more often because people living in overmanaged and underled cultures are generally taught that such actions are not sensible

### Ch 4: Creating the guiding coalition

* **no one individual is ever able to eliminate all key obstacles**
* four key characteristics for the guiding coalition	
  * position power (e.g. main line managers)
  * expertise
  * credibility
  * leadership
* **personnel problems that can be ignored during easy times can cause serious troubles in a tougher, faster-moving, globalizing economy**
* when people fail to develop the coalition needed to guide change, the most common reason is that they don't truly believe that transformation is necessary or they don't think a strong team is needed to direct the change

### Ch 7: Empowering employees for broad-based action

* barriers to empowerment:
  * formal structures make it difficult to act
  * bosses discourage actions aimed at implementing the new vision
  * lack of skill
  * personnel and information systems make it difficult to act

* performance appraisal, compensation, promotions, and succession planning need to be aligned with the new vision

### Ch 8: Generating short-term wins

* the more cynics and resisters, the more important are short-term wins

* > The job of management is to win in the short term while making sure you're in an even stronger position to win in the future.

### Ch 9: Consolidating gains and producing more change

* whenever you let up before the job is done, critical momentum can be lost & regression may follow
* you'll end up making more changes than imagined at first, and it'll take more time and energy; however, you'll be in a better position to do something similar in the future

### Ch 10: Anchoring new approaches in the culture

* because all of this happens w/o much conscious intent and thus is difficult to challenge or even discuss

* > Culture changes only after you've successfully changed people's actions, after the new behavior produces some group benefit for a period of time, and after people see the connection between the new actions and the performance improvement.

### Ch 11: The organization of the future

* **URGENCY:** A higher rate of urgency doesn't imply ever-present panic, anxiety, or fear. It means a state in which complacency is virtually absent, in which people are always looking for both problems and opportunities, and in which the norm is "do it now."
* if time at work does little/nothing to develop leadership skills, we'll probably never live up to our potential

### Ch 12: Leadership and lifelong learning

* > instead of slowing down and peaking at 35/55 y/o, they keep learning at a rate usually only associated with children and young adults

* they don't begin "the race" w/ the most money or intelligence, but they win nevertheless because they outgrow their rivals

* > they grow to become unusually competent in advancing organizational transformation

* mental habits that support lifelong learning

  * solicitation of opinions: aggressive collection of information and ideas from others
  * careful listening: propensity to listen to others
  * openness to new ideas

* > the very best lifelong learners and leaders seem to have high standards, ambitious goals, and a real sense of mission in their lives

* > **people who learn to master more volatile career paths usually become more comfortable with change generally and thus better able to play more useful roles in organizational transformations**
