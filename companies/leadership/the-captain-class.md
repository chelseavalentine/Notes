# The Captain Class: A New Theory of Leadership

### Ch 2: The Importance of "Glue Guys"

* the more cohesive and positive a team perceives itself to be, the better it will perform in many aspects
* **glue guys:** individuals that devote themselves to unifying the team
  * glue that prevents teams form splintering into cliques or being torn by egos
* internal leadership is the single most important thing after you get talent
  * not the coaches as much as a single person with higher standards than those the team would normally set for itself
* characteristics of studied Tier 1 players:
  * they did potentially divisive things
  * weren't the primary leader

### Ch 3: Talent, money, and culture

* presence of a GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) player didn't necessarily lead to wins at the team-level
  * the most dominant team in basketball history (Celtics) didn't have a single elite player
  * a team is more likely to become elite if it has a captain leading it from the shadows
* it isn't a matter of overall talent
  * teams with clusters of above-average performers, whose abilities fell within a narrow range, were best
    * because less delegation to superstar players/highest performers
* it isn't a question of management/team traditions and habits
  * but no matter how motivated a team is, it won't achieve its full potential if management keeps introducing obstacles
* it's not the coach/manager

### Ch 4: Do coaches matter?

* > Perfection is not attainable. But if we chase perfection, we can catch excellence.

* > It's not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get up.

* the winning teams' coaches weren't seasoned winners prior to coaching

* the 7 traits of elite captains:

  1. aggressive play that tests the limits of the rules
  2. willingness to do thankless jobs in the shadows
  3. motivates others with passionate nonverbal displays
  4. strong convictions and the courage to stand apart
  5. extreme doggedness and focus in competitions
  6. a low-key practical, democratic communication style

### Ch 5: They just keep coming – doggedness and its ancilliary benefits

* any athlete that makes it to the highest level of sports was unusually determined

  * > ...but when the going got tough, they didn't get down on themselves. They viewed the unsolved problems as puzzles to be mastered through effort.

* > Winning is difficult, but to win again is much more difficult – because egos appear. Most people who win once have already achieved what they wanted and don't have any more ambition.

### Ch 6: Intelligent fouls

* testing the limits of rules
* aggression is a skill and can be used to/instrumental in achieving a goal
* if your behavior serves a purpose, and you manage to get away with it, then it's an intelligent foul

### Ch 7: Carrying water – the art of leading from the back

* most tier 1 captains had 0 interest in fame
* can't be a star player and a manager at the same time, because it's hard to maintain both; if a star player becomes a manager, you lose a leader

### Ch 8: Boxing ears & wiping noses – practical communication

* be very vocal about praise but also about feedback
* most tier 1 teams have open, talkative cultures which grievances are aired, strategies discussed, and criticisms leveled without delay
  * these groups encouraged everyone to speak up
* it's possible for a team's members to be so familiar with one another that they can unconsciously predict how the other members will respond to just about any event
  * teams that talked intently amongst themselves in the break room were more likely to achieve superior results at work
  * fashion a role as someone who facilitates openness

### Ch 10: Uncomfortable truths – the courage to stand apart

* **consequences of staying silent are greater than the risks of breaking protocol**
* in any high-pressure team environment, dissent is a priceless commodity and an essential component of excellence

### Ch 11: The kill switch – regulating emotion

* **the way a person's brain is wired isn't deterministic**
  * therefore, a propensity to feel negative emotions doesn't necessarily mean you will in real-life situations

### Ch 13: The captaincy in winter – leadership's decline and how to revive it

* to push a team forward, a leader must disrupt its routines and challenge its definition of what's normal
  * must have the courage to stand apart, even if they pay a substantial personal toll for doing so
