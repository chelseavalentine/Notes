# The Art of Action: How Leaders Close the Gaps between Plans, Actions, and Results

### Ch 1: The problem

* **planning and doing are not separate jobs, but rather separate parts of the same job**
* use the knowledge accessible to you to work out the outcomes you want the org to achieve; formulate your strategy as an intent rather than a plan
  * be clear about your intentions; say what you want people to achieve and why

### Ch 2: The cause

* > Friction makes doing simple things difficult and difficult things impossible
* > friction is the totality of "uncertainties, errors, accidents, technical difficulties, the unforeseen and their effect on decisions, morale, and actions"
* don't develop strategies without taking organizational friction into account; we think that everything is going wrong when it is actually going normally
* **The more detailed we make action plans, the more we constrain what people can do, thereby increasing rigidity. Control adds to costs, slowing things down further, increasing rigidity.**

### Ch 3: Elements of a solution

* > Don't command more than is necessary, or plan beyond the circumstances you can foresee.
* it was vital to ensure that every level understood the intentions of the higher command to enable the organization to fulfill its goal
* specifying too much detail shakes the confidence and creates uncertainty if things don't turn out as anticipated (the greater the level of detail, the less likely it is to fit the actual situation)
* the more alignment you have, the more autonomy you can grant

### Ch 4: The knowledge gap

* complexity is the enemy of execution; if an organization is to cope, it should create as much internal predictability as possible

### Ch 5: The alignment gap

* people could be only going through the motions because they don't believe a course of action is feasible, or they don't believe it makes sense
