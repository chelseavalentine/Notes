* the entire selection process is set up to find out exactly where those limits are, who has them, and who can surpass them

### Ch 8: Defanging the beast

* process checks to get better at working together:
  * How're we doing in trying to help each other get better?
  * How's our feedback going? Are we giving enough? How could I make my feedback even more useful to you?
  * How could I receive this feedback in a more open manner?
