# Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter

### Ch 2: The talent magnet

* to uncover people's native skills, ask:
  * What do they do better than anything else that they do? and others?
  * What do they do without effort or being asked?

### Ch 4: The challenger

* once you accept that you don't need to have all the answers, it opens the doors to ask bigger, more provocative, more interesting questions
* seed the opportunity (even if you have a clear vision of the direction, don't just give it people)
  * provide enough information to provoke thinking and help people discover and see the opportunity for themselves (requires that they deeply understand issues)
  * can still provide a starting point and let others fill in the blanks
* need to generate the belief that the impossible is actually possible to encourage people to stretch themselves
  * cocreate the plan/orchestrate an early win
* "extreme questions challenge": no statements, only asking questions

### Ch 5: The debater

* > If you don't have any facts, we'll just use my opinion.

* let people weigh in and they will give you their buy-in

### Ch 6: The investor

* "You're still the lead on it"
* "I'm here to back you up; what do you need from me as you lead this?"
* "I'm happy to help think this through, but I'm still looking to you to lead this going forward."
