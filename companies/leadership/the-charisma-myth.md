# The Charisma Myth

### Ch 1: Charisma demystified

* speaking tweaks:
  * lower intonation at the end of sentences
  * reduce how quickly and how often you nod
  * pause for 2 seconds before you speak

### Ch 3: Obstacles to presence, power, and warmth

* physical discomfort (e.g. hunger) can impair attention and ability to regulate emotions and behavior
  * counteract it with: (1) prevention, (2) recognizing it, (3) remedy/explain it
* dealing with uncertainty: realize you aren't responsible for the outcome (if that's true)
* be aware of, and moderate, dissatisfaction caused by comparison
* de-dramatize discomfort
  * it's a part of the human experience, and many people experience this burden
  * don't assume your thoughts are valid, you could be missing a lot of information
  * rewrite reality: perhaps the behaviors were for another reason

### Ch 5: Creating charismatic mental states

* visualize success: the event, feelings, music
* feeling warmth: gratitude, appreciation, using good will in interactions, being compassionate, have self-compassion
  * self-compassion: (1) recognize you're facing difficulty, (2) respond with kindness and understanding rather than harsh criticism, and (3) remember everyone experiences this

### Ch 6: Different charisma styles

* **focus charisma:** the type that makes people feel heard, listened to, and understood (should be balanced with warmth/genuine respect)
* **visionary charisma:** making others feel inspired/believe
* **kindness charisma:** radiating acceptance (primarily warmth)
* **authority charisma:** perception of power (via clothing, body language, etc.)
  * disadvantages: inhibits others' critical thinking and feedback, you could look more arrogant

### Ch 8: Speaking – and listening – with charisma

* refraining from interrupting (Even if it's from excitement at what they said); deliberate pausing
* let others interrupt you
* pause before responding (face absorbs what they said, reacts, and then finally speaks)
* need to establish a ratio of neutral/good to bad news
* use the power of images and senses in your speech
* use vocal power with voice fluctuations, pitch and tone, and slow, measured tempo, and vocal warmth

### Ch 9: Charismatic body language

* avoid excessive verbal reassurance when someone is talking

### Ch 10: Difficult situations

* have props for the person to fidget with

### Ch 11:Presenting with charisma

* presentations engage authority, visionary, and kindness charisma

### Ch 12: Charisma in crisis

* remain/appear calm
* express high expectations

### Ch 13: The charismatic life

* when others envy your success, a good approach is to reflect the success to them, but the best approach is to transfer the success to a person who helped you; w/ these steps:
  1. excuse for contacting them
  2. appreciation
  3. how they helped you
  4. positive impact they've had on you
  5. give them as much credit as you can
