# The 4 Disciplines of Execution: Achieving Your Wildly Important Goals

### The real problem with execution

* any time the majority of people behave a particular way the majority of the time, the people aren't the problem; the problem is inherent in the system

### Discipline 1: Focus on the wildly imporant goal (WIG)

* focus on the 1 or 2 goals that will make all the difference, instead of giving mediocre effort to dozens of goals
* multitasking makes you less deliberative and gives you less capacity to think and reason out a problem
* **in determing your wildly important goal, ask "if every other area of operation remained at its current level of performance, what is the one area where change would have the greatest impact?"** 
  * then ask, what's the fewest number of battles to win this war?
* without involvement, you can't create the high levels of commitment that execution requires; senior leaders determine the top-level goal, but leaders of subteams must define the goals for their teams, allowing them to leverage their knowledge and increase their ownership
* every WIG at every level should have a clearly measurable result, and the date by which the result should be achieved
* > I'm as proud of what we don't do as I am of what we do. (Steve Jobs)

### Discipline 2: Act on the lead measures

* the leveraged actions that will enable the team to achieve the goal
* a **lag measure** tells you whether you've achieved the goal whereas a **lead measure** tells you whether you're likely to achieve the goal
  - you only have control over the lead measures; they should be within you/your team's control (i.e. very few/no external dependencies)
* define the daily or weekly measurements, such that the achievement of those will lead to the goal; this way you're creating a just-in-time plan to quickly adapt
* to achieve a goal you've never achieved before, you must do things you've never done before

### Discipline 3: Keep a compelling scoreboard

* make sure everyone knows the score at all times, so that they can tell whether they're winning (thus leading to engagement)
* it should be clear enough that you can tell whether you're winning within 5 seconds
* a winning team doesn't need artificial morale boosting because they derive enough satisfaction from executing with excellence towards a goal that matters

### Discipline 4: Create a cadence of accountability

* create a frequently recurring cycle of accounting for past performance and planning to move the score forward
* three reasons why individuals disengage from work (from _The Three Signs of a Miserable Job_)
  1. anonymity: they feel their leaders don't know or care what they're doing
  2. irrelevance: they don't understand how their job makes a difference
  3. immeasurement: they can't measure or assess their contribution for themselves

### What to expect

* first, focus on the adherence to the process and then on the results
* you can't make the leap to great performance as long as you're content with the normal curve

### Installing discipline 1: Focus on the wildly important

* team members must have active input in defining the WIG to gain commitment
* 3 useful questions to discover the WIG:
  1. Which area of our team's performance would we want to improve the most in order to achieve the overall WIG of the organization?
  2. What're the greatest strengths of the team that can be leveraged to ensure the overall WIG is achieved?
  3. What are the areas where the team's poor performance most needs to be improved to ensure the overall WIG is achieved?

### Installing discipline 2: Act on the

* lead measures are hard to keep track of; there's often no readily available system for tracking lead measures, so you might have to invent one
* lead measures often look too simple: they demand a precise focus on a certain behavior that may look insignificant to people outside of the team
* two types of lead measures: small outcomes and leveraged behaviors
* if your WIG consists of multiple projects, your lead measures are more likely to be procedures that you're using to ensure success in all of the projects (e.g. completion of formal scoping, etc.); you should choose the most predictive and influenceable components of the project process

### Installing discipline 4: Create a cadence of accountability

* define weekly goals so that accountability can be maintained (i.e. if you commit to a goal that takes 4 weeks, you can be unaccountable for 3 of those weeks)

### Best practices from the best

* when you celebrate your accomplishments, don't thankt he senior leaders because they didn't do anything; there's never been a WIG that was accomplished by a senior leader
