# The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership

* the "not enough resources" and "I/we are not enough" beliefs create a zero-sum game with winners and losers, haves and have-nots
* **you can know your commitments by your results**
* Commitment 3: feeling all feelings
  * **anger means that something is no longer useful/not useful**
  * **fear means something is important and needs to be known**
* Commitment 4: speaking candidly
  * projection is seeing others through your judgments and believing they're right
