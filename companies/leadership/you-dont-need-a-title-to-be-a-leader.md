# You Don't Need a Title to Be a Leader

### Leaders increase ROI

> To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts. (Henry David Thoreau)

### Principle 1: The power of self-mastery

* > All leadership begins with self-mastery. You can't lead others until you can first lead yourself.
* When handling tasks/requests/etc., the difference isn't it whether it's an obligation, opportunity, etc., it's in your response
* The challenge for anyone is to make a life while making a living; that means making money and meaning during the workday. What you do on the weekends and evenings becomes the icing on the cake.
* the worst thing that can happen is to exhaust your intellectual capital; it should be constantly refreshed by gathering new information and thinking critically
* take time to look up and think; it helps separate the mundane things in your life from the significant; it can help clarify your direction and purpose
* the fastest way to burn out is to stop doing what you enjoy
* remember to aspire high enough regarding the future of yourself and perhaps also your organization
* when you find problems worthy of your attention, ask how you can make a difference; assume that you can make a difference, even if it's a small one
  * for complex problems, it often requires many answers with contributions from many different people or parties
* complaining = only calling attention to a problem (as opposed to contributing to solving it)

### Principle 2: The power of focus

* focus and determination beats intellect every time; you don't need to be smarter, you just need to focus on what's important
* waiting is an intentional choice, requiring patience and deliberation for something to happen, whereas drifting takes away your power of choice
* to lead effectively, you can't wait for random events to help you achieve your goals; you need to plan to do things of significance and impact, and then strategically pursue them
* ensure that the things you're doing each day contribute to your long-range goals

### Principle 3: Power with people

* > Leadership is the art of getting extraordinary performance from ordinary people.
* one of the most effective ways to engage others is to ask for their help/opinions
* if you undersell what you need from others out of a fear of rejection, you tend to get little in return; if you ask for a big commitment, you'll increase the likelihood of getting a big effort in return

### Principle 4: The power of persuasive communication

* ask "Do I have your word on that?" as a technique to ensure commitment from others
* great leaders aren't evaludated on the length at which they speak, but on the impact of their message

### Principle 5: The power of execution

* > You cannot build a reputation on what you are going to do. (Henry Ford)
* having good ideas isn't enough; you need to be able to implement them
* to create an effective plan, ask:
  1. why are we doing this?
  2. who is responsible for each task?
  3. when will things happen?
* hold people accountable for results rather than activity
* to qualm fears, you can ask (1) how would you feel if you did it? and (2) how would you feel if you didn't do it?

### Principle 6: The power of giving

* you can't give to others without being affected positively yourself

### Leaving a leadership legacy

* don't confuse resume skills with leadership skills
