# Unlocking Leadership Mindtraps: How to Thrive in Complexity

### Ch 1: The five quirks and how they become traps

* mind traps:
  1. Simple stories
  2. Rightness
  3. Agreement
  4. Control
  5. Our ego
* **understanding how to notice and escape mindtraps allows you to see new opportunities, create new solutions, and move forward with finesse and less angst**
* **when we try to defend our egos rather than grow and change, we end up perfectly designed for a world that happened already, instead of growing better able to handle the world that's coming next**

### Ch 2: Trapped by simple stories: Your desire for a simple story blinds you to a real one

* **we project forward from the past into the future and fill in missing pieces so it all makes sense**
  * consistency makes for a good story â€“ not completeness; the less you know, the easier it is to construct a coherent story
* to break free of simplified villains in your life, reframe their actions as the way they'd see and experience things
* **key habit: create at least 3 stories to describe actions**
  * It'll make you prepared for any scenario: including those you can't think of

### Ch 3: Trapped by rightness: Just because it feels right, doesn't mean it is

* your sense of being right isn't certainty, a thought process, or reasoning; it's just an emotion
* our experience of rightness changes the way we treat others
* key questions: What do I believe and how could I be wrong?

### Ch 4: Trapped by agreement: Longing for alignment robs you of good ideas

* we believe disagreement should be fixed with compromise
* **key question: Could this conflict serve to deepen a relationship?**
  * requires listening to learn, confronting only to deepen, and the belief that people can disagree with us and still be right

### Ch 5: Trapped by control: Taking charge strips you of influence

* shift from thinking about incomes to considering how you could enable the direction you want

### Ch 6: Trapped by ego: Shackled to who you are now, you can't reach for who you'll be next

* **we're ashamed of our humanity; others are drawn to us because of it**
* key question: Who do you want to be next?
* **listen to learn from yourself:**
  1. What's at stake for me here?
  2. What's the hardest part about this?
  3. What's the best part about this?
  4. How do I know this is true?

### Ch 7: Building a ladder to escape the mindtraps

* notice your body's reactions and how they connect to the mindtraps
