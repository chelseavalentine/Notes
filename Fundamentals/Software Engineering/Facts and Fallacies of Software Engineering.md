# Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering

Facts from the book. Most of them are ones that I found interesting or want to verify. Either way, I wanted to have some kind of notes from this book.


### Facts: About Management

##### People

* "The most important factor in software work is _not_ the tools and techniques used by the programmers, but rather the quality of the programmers themselves."
    - "... projects succeed or fail primarily based on who does the work rather than how it's done."
* "The best programmers are up to 28 times better than the worst programmers"
* "The working environment has a profound impact on productivity and product quality"
    - "the hard drives out the soft"
        + "those things that are solidly measurable ('hard things') tend to take away from those that are not (the 'soft' ones)."

##### Tools & Learning Curves

* "Learning a new tool or technique actually lowers programmer productivity and product quality initially. The eventual benefit is achieved only after this learning curve is overcome. Therefore it is worth adopting new tools and techniques, but only (a) if their value is seen realistically and (b) if patience is used in measuring benefits."

##### Estimates

* "One of the two most common causes of runaway projects is poor estimation."
    - "Most of our estimates are more like wishes than realistic targets."
* "Most software estimates are performed at the beginning of the life cycle. This makes sense until we realize that estimates are obtained before the requirements are defined and thus before the problem is understood. Estimation, therefore, usually occurs at the wrong time."
* "Most software estimates are made either by upper management or by marketing, not by the people who will build the software or their managers. Estimation is, therefore, done by the wrong people."
* "Since estimates are so faulty, there is little reason to be concerned when software projects do not meet estimated targets. But everyone is concerned anyway."
* "The answer to a feasibility study is almost always 'yes.'"

##### Reuse

* "There are two 'rules of three' in reuse: (a) It is three times as difficult to build reusable components as single use components, and (b) a reusable component should be tried out in three different applications before it will be sufficiently general to accept into a reuse library."
* "Modification of reused code is particularly error-prone. If more than 20 to 25 percent of a component is to be revised, it is more efficient and effective to rewrite it from scratch."
* "Design pattern reuse is one solution to the problems inherent in code reuse."
    - "Designers rarely start from scratch."
    - Design pattern - "description of a problem that occurs over and over again, accompanied by a design solution to that problem"
        + elements: name, description of when solution should be applied, solution, & consequences of the solution
    - __Suggestion:__ read _Design Patterns_ by Erich Gamma

##### Complexity

* "For every 25% increase in problem complexity, there's a 100% increase in complexity of the software solution."
