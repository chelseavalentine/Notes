## Bad Arguments

* __red herring__: drawing the attention away from a proposition by discussing the propsition's result
    - says nothing about the truth of the statement(s)
* __straw man__: to take a version/caricature of someone's argument & attack that, rather than the original argument
    - misrepresenting, misquoting, misconstruing, and/or oversimplifying
* __appeal to irrelevant authority__
* __appeal to vague authority__
* __appeal to ancient wisdom__


* __equivocation__: exploiting the ambiguity of language by changing the meaning of a word mid-argument, & using the different meanings to support a crap conclusion
* __false dilemma__: argument that presents a limited set of 2 categories, & claims it encompasses the universal set
    - forced to accept one or the other
* __not a cause for cause__: assuming there's a cause for an event when there's no evidence that a cause exists
    - could be coincidence, or due to an unknown factor
    - confusing correlation with causation
* __appeal to fear__: makes people imagine a scary future if proposition was accepted, rather than give solid evidence that the proposition would go there
    - not the same as blatant threats/orders
* __hasty generalization__: forming a conclusion from a sample that's too small/special to be representative


* __appeal to ignorance__: assuming a proposition is true because there's no evidence proving it false
* __argument from personal incredulity__: when a person's inability to imagine something leads them to believe it's false
* __no true scotsman__: happens when someone makes a general claim about a group of things, so the person just redefines the criteria for membership in that group to dodge the argument
* __genetic fallacy__: when an argument is devalued/defended solely because of its origins
* __guilt by association__: discrediting an argument because it's also proposed by a socially demonized individual/group
    - _non sequitur_: a conclusion/statement that doesn't logically follow from the previous argument/statement


* __affirming the consequent__: the opposite of modus ponens, where you argue if A then C, C; hence A.
    - _modus ponens_ (the mode of affirming): If A then C, A; hence C.
        + this argument is sound and valid.
* __appeal to hypocrisy__: countering someone's argument by pointing out that it conflicts with his/her own past actions/statements
    - diverts attention from the argument at hand to the person making it
* __slippery slope argument__: discrediting a proposition by arguing that its acceptance will lead to a sequence of events, 1+ of which are undesirable
    - they assume every event in the sequence is inevitable, without providing evidence to support that
    - includes _appeal to fear_, _false dilemma_, & _argument from consequence
* __appeal to the bandwagon__: arguing that because many/the majority of people believe in something, it must be true
* __ad hominem__: attacking the person, rather than the argument the person is making, to divert the discussion & discredit their argument
    - _circumstantial ad hominem_: attacking a person for cynical reasons, usually by making a judgment about their intentions

* __circular reasoning__: implicitly/explicitly assuming the conclusion in 1+ of the premises
    - in circular reasoning, a conclusion is either blatantly used as a premise, or it's reworded to appear as though it's a different proposition, when it isn't
* __fallacy of composition__: inferring that because parts of the whole have a particular attribute, the whole must have that attribute, too
* __fallacy of division__: inferring that a part of the whole has a particular attribute, because the whole has the attribute

## More Definitions

* __falsifiable__: a proposition/argument that can be refuted/disproved through observation/expriment
    - falsifiability is a sign of an argument's strength
* __logical fallacy__: an error that --> violating a principle of good arguments: good structure, consistency, clarity, order, relevance, & completeness 
    - __formal fallacy__: an error b/c of faulty structure
    - __informal fallacy__: an error b/c of faulty content/context, rather than form
* __deductive argument__: an argument in which if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true
    - __valid__: when the conclusion follows logically from its premises
    - __sound__: a deductive argument is sound if it's valid & its premises are true
* __inductive argument__: an argument in which if the premises are true, then it's probable that the conclusion is also true
    - __strong__: an inductive argument is strong if the premises are true, then it's highly probable that its conclusion is true
    - __cogent__: an inductive argument is cogent if it's strong & the premises are actually true (in accordance w/ facts)
