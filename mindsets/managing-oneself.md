# _Managing Oneself_ by Peter Drucker

Notes on the Harvard Business Review article.

* __feedback analysis__: whenever you make a key decision or take a key action, write down what you expect will happen, and then revisit it 6+ months later to see whether the results matched
  - purpose is to help you determine your strengths, and realize the bad habits that come in the way of materializing your expectations

* you need to learn your performance style, for instance: some people are better readers (i.e. listen and read to learn) and others are better writers (i.e. write things down to learn), talkers, and so on

> To work in an organization whose value system is unacceptable or incompatible with one's own condemns a person both to frustration and to non performance.

> What one does well – even very well and successfully – may not fit with one's value system. In that case, the work may not appear to be worth devoting one's life to (or even a substantial portion thereof).

> The question in most cases should be, "Where and how can I achieve results that will make a difference in the next year and a half?"

* you need to understand how your coworkers work as well, if you don't work for them in a way that works best for them, it'll be significantly more ineffective
