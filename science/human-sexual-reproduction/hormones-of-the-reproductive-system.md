# Hormones of the Reproductive System

* hormones pass through circulating blood (endocrine) and between cells by diffusion
  * they regulate gene expression or trigger biological processes
  * they bind with receptor molecules
* **protein/peptide hormones** bind to the cells' external area, causing a change within the cell (e.g. gonadotrophins, sex steroids)
* **steroid (fat-like) hormones** pass through the membrane and bind to the receptors, then move into the nucleus and regulate the DNA transcription (e.g. gonadal progestins, androgens, estrogens, etc)

### The Anterior Pituitary Gland

* the **hypothalamus** releases peptides (releasing hormones), such as **gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH)**, which triggers the pituitary gonadotroph's GnRH receptors to release the gonadotrophins
  * estrogen sensitizes the gonadotrophs to GnRH by inducing the expression of their GnRH receptors
* secretes both [1] releasing hormones, and [2] neurohormones, oxytocin, and vasopressin, which are released into circulation and act on target organs (e.g. uterus or breasts)
* the adenohypophysis amplifies the hypothalamic signal (tiny GnRH signal is heard by the gonads)
* estradiol from gonads inhibits GnRH secretion
  * estrogen-induced positive feedback only occurs in women (before ovulation)

### Meiosis vs. Mitosis steps

* the phases happen twice in meiosis
* metaphase I is the same, but in anaphase I, the homologous chromosome pairs are pulled apart and migrate to each side
  * the result is 23 chromosomes still attached at the centromere
* meiosis II: 2 cells with chromosomes in an "X" shape start DNA condensing in prophase II, and everything is as usual, but we get 4 single chromatids
