# The ELISA pregnancy test

* ELISA = Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay
  * uses antibodies to sandwich the present hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin hormone), which allows the attached dye-activating enzyme to create a color change
* hCG signals the body not to shed the inner lining of the uterus that month
  * hCG also supports the placenta's formation

### How birth control works

* it contains **progestin** (synthetic progesterone), which decreases gNRH and inhibits the release of FSH and LH
  * the lack of LH prevents ovulation
  * progestin also increases the viscosity of the cervical mucus, preventing/slowing the entry of sperm
* there're also low levels of estrogen, which stabilize the endometrium and inhibit follicular development via decreased FSH release
