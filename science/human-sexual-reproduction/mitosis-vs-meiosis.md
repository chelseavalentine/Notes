# Mitosis vs. Meiosis

* cells reproduce with mitosis if they're somatic (body) cells, and it results in 2 identical copies with 46 chromosomes
* sex cells (gametes) use meiosis and produce 4 cells (gametes) with 23 chromosomes each, and aren't identical copies â€” they're haploids
  * testes produce male sex cells (sperm) and the ovaries produce eggs; these producers are our gonads
* **germ line:** the unique cellular lineage of the genetic material to be passed on
* there's no crossing over between X and Y chromosomes!

### Mitosis

* mitosis only occurs for somatic cells (body cells)

* **Interphase:** the normal state of the cell carrying out its functions
  * Stage 1: Gap 1: cell almost grows to its full size
  * Stage 2: Synthesis: DNA in the nucleus replicates, creating 2 copies per DNA strand
  * Stage 3: Gap 2: more growth, now the cell is ready to carry out mitosis
    * centrosomes (set of protein cylinders near the nucleus) duplicate, and they control chromosomal movement during mitosis
* Prophase: chromatin condense into chromosomes, and each has a sister
* Metaphase: chromosomes attach to the microtubules at their centromeres and line up along the cell equator/metaphase plate
* Anaphase: chromosomes separate from their sister chromatids, and they're pulled apart toward either parts of the cell
* Telophase: the nuclear membrane reforms around the chromosomes, and they split into two new cells (**cytokinesis**) due to the crease at the metaphase plate
