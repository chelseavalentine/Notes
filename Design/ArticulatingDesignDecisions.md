## Articulating Design Decisions

### Chapter 1: A Maturing Industry

> "What are we trying to communicate?"

> “I had to answer their questions in a way that made sense to them, not me.”


### Chapter 2: Great Designers Are Great Communicators

On teamwork in design:
> "One suggestion evolves into an idea for something else. That idea spurs a thought about something different. Unchecked, the conversation can spiral out of control into a hodgepodge of well-intentioned tweaks that collectively spell doom for the overall goals of the project. The thing we came together to accomplish has been muddied by group think and mob mentality."

* articulating a design
  - imparts intelligence
  - demonstrates intentionality
  - expresses confidence
  - shows respect

* in order for a design to be successful:
  - solves a problem
  - easy for users
  - supported by everyone

* establish goals/metrics/key performance indicators (KPIs), otherwise it's a futile discussion of opinions
  - most important thing to stakeholders (eg. impressions, conversion, sign ups)

* for each thing you do, think about what problem you're trying to solve (thereby documenting your thought process)
  > Writing down how you see your work will reveal many of your motivations

* for each design change, you can have the design change, & a description of how it affects the user
  - “be consciously aware of why your design decisions are better than the alternatives.”
    + can create simple wireframes of alternate solutions

> “When people aren’t convinced that you’re right, they’ll continue to think of alternatives to suggest.”

1. What problem does it solve?
2. How does it affect the user?
3. Why is it better than the alternative?
