## Articulating Design Decisions

### Chapter 1: A Maturing Industry

> "What are we trying to communicate?"

> “I had to answer their questions in a way that made sense to them, not me.”


### Chapter 2: Great Designers Are Great Communicators

On teamwork in design:
> "One suggestion evolves into an idea for something else. That idea spurs a thought about something different. Unchecked, the conversation can spiral out of control into a hodgepodge of well-intentioned tweaks that collectively spell doom for the overall goals of the project. The thing we came together to accomplish has been muddied by group think and mob mentality."

* articulating a design
  - imparts intelligence
  - demonstrates intentionality
  - expresses confidence
  - shows respect

* in order for a design to be successful:
  - solves a problem
  - easy for users
  - supported by everyone

* establish goals/metrics/key performance indicators (KPIs), otherwise it's a futile discussion of opinions
  - most important thing to stakeholders (eg. impressions, conversion, sign ups)

* for each thing you do, think about what problem you're trying to solve (thereby documenting your thought process)
  > Writing down how you see your work will reveal many of your motivations

* for each design change, you can have the design change, & a description of how it affects the user
  - “be consciously aware of why your design decisions are better than the alternatives.”
    + can create simple wireframes of alternate solutions

> “When people aren’t convinced that you’re right, they’ll continue to think of alternatives to suggest.”

1. What problem does it solve?
2. How does it affect the user?
3. Why is it better than the alternative?


### Chapter 3: Understanding Relationships

> “What’s ironic to me is that UXers are so good at putting the user first, at garnering empathy for and attempting to see the interface from the perspective of the user. Yet, we often fail to do the same thing for the people who hold the keys to our success.”

> “ There are always things that are influencing people’s behaviors that we are not privy to. And there will always be things that we simply can’t predict. Always. ”

> “it’s often a best practice when working with executives to show both what’s possible in the short term and what’s preferred for the future. This approach creates a buzz that keeps everyone excited and makes it more likely that they’ll agree with you.”


### Chapter 4: Reducing Cognitive Load

* for each person in a meeting, while planning a design discussion, ask yourself:
  - What do they care about the most?
  - What are their personal goals for this design?
  - What do I already know they want or don't want?

* write down objections you expect people to have


### Chapter 5: Listening is Understanding

* listen for the vocabulary people use when discussing your work, & use them in response

* pause after people are done talking, so that you're sure that thy're done + you can think about it

* discuss things in terms of effectiveness, not preference ("likes" -> "works")


### Chapter 6: The Right Frame of Mind

* when receiving design feedback, he recommends:
  1. thank
  2. repeat (summarize what they said)
  3. prepare stakeholders by telling them you're about to respond to their feedback

### Chapter 7: The Response: Strategy and Tactics

* how to craft a good response:
  1. define a strategy for responding
  2. employ tactics to deliver the strategy
  3. identify common, relevant responses (what key messages do we include)
  4. apply a common framework & ask for agreement

* appeal to a nobler motive (eg. goal, metric, other problem)
