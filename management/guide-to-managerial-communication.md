# Guide to Managerial Communication

## Chapter 1: Communication strategy

* communication is a circle, with its success being based on whether you achieve your desired audience response

### What's your objective?

* Clarify your objective by thinking of the following things:
    - __general objective:__ overall goal to which each communication point will target
    - __action objective:__ planned series of action outcome (specific, measurable, time-bound steps); i.e. accomplishing a specific result by a specific time
    - __communication objective:__ the result you aim to achieve from a single communication effort (e.g. report, email, presentation)
        + "As a result of this communication, my audience will... [what they should do/know/think as a result]"

* example objectives:
    1. Example one:
        * General: Keep management aware of new HR initiatives
        * Action: Report 2x per quarter
        * Communication: As a result of this presentation, my boss will learn the results of two new HR programs

### Communication styles

* __tell/sell style__:
    - _tell_/inform/explain something you already know
    - _sell_ = persuading or advocating, because you want the audience to change their thinking or behavior
    - requires the following:
        + you have sufficient information
        + you don't need to hear others' opinions, ideas, or input
        + you want to control the message content

* __consult/join style__: (a.k.a. inquiry style) where you want to learn from the audience
    - requires the following:
        + you don't have sufficient information
        + you want to understand others' opinions, ideas, or input
        + you want to involve your audience and gain their buy-in

### Credibility

* 5 factors affecting your credibility:
    1. rank
        * emphasizing title/rank; association with or citing a high-ranking person
    2. goodwill
        * referring to relationship/track record; emphasizing audience benefits
        * offering balanced evaluation & acknowledging conflicts of interest
    3. expertise
        * sharing your expert understanding
        * explaining how you gained your expertise
        * associating with or citing authoritative sources
    4. image
        * attractiveness, audience's desire to be like you
        * associating with high-image people
        * authenticity, sincerity; communicating openly and showing appropriate emotion
    5. common ground
        * common values, ideas, problems, or needs
        * tying the message to your common ground

* important to stress/remind audience of your __initial credibility__; if that's high, you have higher trust for unpopular/extreme decisions/recommendations

### Audience strategy

* gearing your message toward the audience's needs and interests

* "Communication takes place in the mind of the listener, not the speaker"

* the way you analyze your __primary audience__ changes with familiarity:
    - unknown audience
        * demographics (age, education, org, location, rank, language fluency
        * knowledge & beliefs; preferences (e.g. formality, communication method, etc.)
    - familiar audience
        * likes & dislikes
        * typical behavior and tendencies
        * preferred level of detail

* you also have a __secondary audience__ (people who are CC'd, overhear things, people who can undercut or block your message later)
    - you should also think about how they'll communicate your message later (e.g. forward an email, comment, post, etc.)

* think about what they already know and how much background information they need, the style they'll expect, etc.

* consider their format expectations, such as:
    - timing: how long it should be, where it fits on the agenda
    - visual aids

* think about what emotions they feel
    - are they pressured for time? what's the economic situation? what's the current morale?
    - what emotions may they feel about your message?

* how interested are they in your message?
    - what priority level does your message have? how closely will they listen? how curious are they?
    - based on the interest level, you can present in different ways:
        * __high interest__:
            - get right to the point
            - build a good logical argument, but don't expect a change of opinion w/o continued effort
        * __low interest__:
            - use a consult/join style, asking for participation/sharing control
            - keep your message as short as possible
            - act quickly on attitude changes (because they can be fleeting)

* what's their probable bias towards your ideas/recommendations?
    - if it's __positive/neutral__:
        * reinforce the existing attitude by stating the benefits from your message
    - if it's __negative__:
        1. convince them there's a problem, then solve the problem
        2. state problems they'd agree with first, then sell on other features
        3. limit your request to be as small as possible (e.g. a pilot)
        4. respond to anticipated objections (state and rejecting alternatives yourselves, rather than allowing them to devise their own)

* is your desired action easy or hard for them?

* what will persuade them?
    - tangible benefits (e.g. profit, results, items, etc.)
    - career or task benefits (emphasizing career advancement/prestige/reputation)
    - ego benefits (self-worth, accomplishment, achievement)
    - personality benefits
    - group benefits (benefits to group as a whole, group consensus over individual preferences, group comparisons (e.g. benchmarking or bandwagoning))
    - consistency benefits (get them to say something publicly or put it in writing)

* persuade with message structure
    - opening and closing: emphasize audience benefits
    - the problem/solution structure
    - one-sided vs. two-sided structure (depending on the controversiality)
    - pro/con (for noncontroversial subjects or if high credibility) vs. con/pro
    - inoculation technique: presenting a mild opposing view
    - ascending vs. descending order for strength of arguments
        * ascending with informed/interested audiences
        * descending order for less-informed/less-engaged audiences
    - ask for less/foot in door technique
    - ask for more/door in face technique
        * extreme request that you fully expect to be rejected, followed by a moderate request

### Message strategy

* ineffective communicators just data dump onto their audience; state your conclusion first and then go into your organized ideas

* direct approaches/"conclusion first" has multiple benefits:
    - is audience-centric because it focuses on what they want to know, not on how you figured it out
    - people can understand content more readily when they know the conclusions/significance first
    - focuses on the bottom-line

* indirect approaches/"conclusion last" is okay when:
    - the message is unpopular, and you want to soften the resistance
    - high sensitivity, low credibility, and a negatively biased/hostile audience
    - cultural norms necessitate it

* overcoming retention dips in the middle of your argument:
    - flag items (e.g. "here's the critical point", "if you only remember one thing, remember...")
    - unexpected format, delivery, story, etc.
    - visuals for reinforcement

* message organization methods:
    - key points
    - key questions
    - steps in a process
    - alternatives to compare
    - list of recommendations (direct approach)
    - list of benefits (direct approach)
    - problem and possible solutions (indirect approach)

* elements of stories:
    - inciting incident
    - a protagonist
    - obstacles and conflict
    - something at stake
    - a critical point of choice or decision
    - a result
    - concrete, vivid details

### Channel choices strategy

* questions to ask that inform the mode of communication to use:
    - is there an audience/cultural preference?
    - how much audience interaction do you want?
    - do you want to communicate nonverbally?
    - do you want to control the timing of your message?
    - do you want a permanent record?
    - how much detail do you want to communicate?
    - what're the risks?

* benefits of __writing__:
    - have a permanent record
    - get across complex, detailed information
    - be precise and edit
    - save your audience time
    - receive considered feedback (because audience has time to reply)
    - reach a public, undefined audience
* benefits of __presentations__:
    - get nonverbal feedback
    - ensure that everyone hears the message at the same time
    - enhance group interaction
    - receive immediate group feedback
    - build community

* benefits of __1:1 communication__:
    - get immediate feedback from an individual
    - build relationship/rapport

### Culture strategy

* some cultures may prefer tell styles (e.g. autocratic ones), whereas democratic cultures may favor consult styles

## Chapter 2: Writing: Composing efficiently

### General composing techniques

* set communication strategy first, paying attention to audience's needs & expectations

* clearly differentiate among the different stages of the process: (1) researching, (2) organizing, (3) focusing information, (4) drafting, and (5) editing

#### 1. Research

#### 2. Organize

* Bucket similar ideas, and put those buckets in order
    - you can create an organizational blueprint to organize the ideas (linear, tree, circular, etc.)

#### 3. Focus

* imagine the reader skimming

* nutshell your ideas, and also try teaching them

* formulate a thesis statement, or "bottom line"

#### 4. Draft

* write out sections you're most comfortable with first, and avoid editing while you write
    - drafting should be creative; don't worry about problems as they arise

* print a hard copy

* schedule a time gap between creative drafting and analytical editing stages

#### 5. Edit

1. __Step 1:__ Edit for strategy

2. __Step 2:__ Edit for macro issues, such as:
    * high skim value (e.g. headings, lists, whitespace, typography, short paragraphs)
    * clear progression and linkage
    * effective paragraphs/sections

3. __Step 3:__ Edit for micro issues (sentences and words)

4. __Step 4:__ Edit for correctness (grammar/punctuation)

### Special composing challenges

* writer's block
    - write your headings first, then bullet points, then flesh out each one
    - re-sketch the idea chart

## Chapter 3: Writing: Macro issues

### Document design for high-skim value

* using standalone headings and subheadings
    - make it such that your headings & subheadings can make sense on their own
    - standalone headings provide key takeaways of your message, not the topics
    - e.g. "Open new office in Singapore", "Use team-building to increase effectiveness", "Recommendation: ..."

* use grammar and conceptual parallelism in your headings (i.e. they should be the same kind of item, and written in the same kind of way)

* using whitespace
    - ident the entire section so that numbered/bullet-pointed sections are easier to read

### Clear progression and linkage

#### Throughout the message
* it's easier to grasp the message if there're back-and-forth references and section previews (if it's a longer document)
    - both reference forwards and reference backwards

#### In the introduction

* establish a common context ("what exists")
    - either the existing situation and why you're writing, or a common ground that you share with the reader

* explain your purpose for writing
    - i.e. what you want to tell them, what you want them to do, or what your opinion is

* make your structure explicit (set expectations)

* depending on your credibility, you should structure your introduction differently
    - low credibility/lower agreement: establish common context first
    - high credibility/indifferent audience: state your preview/purpose first

#### In the closing

* effective closings:
    - feedback mechanism (mention when you'll ask for feedback)
    - what-next step (what they should do if they want to act on this email)
    - goodwill ending (e.g. "I look forward to working with you on this project")

### Effective paragraphs and sections

* each paragraph should have: (1) generalization and support, and (2) signposts to clearly connect the ideas within each paragraph

#### Generalization and support

* transitional words & phrases (e.g. "most importantly", "in addition", "finally")
    - __addition/amplification__: and; furthermore; besides; next; moreover; in addition; again; also; similarly; too; finally; second; subsequently; last
    - __contrast__: but; or; nor; yet; still; however; nevertheless; on the contrary; on the other hand; conversely; although
    - __example__: for example; for instance; such as; thus; that is
    - __sequence__: first; second; third; next; then
    - __conclusion__: therefore; thus; then; in conclusion; consequently; as a result; accordingly; finally
    - __time or place__: at the same time; simultaneously; above; below; further on; so far; until now

## Chapter 4: Writing: Micro issues

### Editing for brevity

* avoid overusing linking verbs (e.g. to be, become, seem, appear, sound, feel, is, after, as, before, between, like, in, over, through, etc.)
    - strategy: circle/highlight all instances of linking verbs

* don't use phony subjects that don't refer to the actual person or entity performing the action
    - e.g. "It was...", "There are..."

* avoid using too many prepositions
    - if there're 4+ consistently in a sentence, you need to revise & shorten

* avoid compound prepositions (e.g. "in order to", "in regard to", "in advance of", "in the event that", etc.)

* avoid elongated verbs with prepositions
    - e.g. "give consideration to", "make assumptions about", "is dependent on"

* avoid overlong sentences (12-24 words is a good average to try to hit)
    - check for too many main ideas in a sentence (signaled by 'and' more than once in a sentence)
    - check for hard-to-find main ideas in a sentence

### Choosing a style

* how formal? how passive? how much jargon?
