# The Five Dysfunctions of a Team

The dysfunctions are numbered 1-5, with number 1 being the base of the pyramid.

## Part 2: Lighting the fire

> the only true measure of a team is to achieve results

* __Dysfunction #1: Absence of trust__
    - don't hold back with one another
    - admit their mistakes, weaknesses, and concerns without fear of reprisal
    - evidence: invulnerability

* indicators of dysfunction #1 (absence of trust)
    - lack of debate during meetings
    - not comfortable challenging each other
    - not agreeing, while also not willing to admit having concerns
    - not having overcome the need for invulnerability

* indicators of trust
    - when a conversation that's wasting the groups time is occurring, people feel free to speak up

* __Dysfunction #5: Inattention to results__
    - the tendency of team members to seek out individual recognition and attention at the expense of results
        * results = the collective results â€“ the goals of the entire team
    - the key is to make the collective ego greater than the individual ones
    - evidence: status and ego

* in most sports, there's a clear score at the end of the game that determines whether you succeeded or failed; there's little room for ambiguity

* focusing on results instead of individual recognition = everyone adopting a set of common goals and measurements, and then actually using them to make collective decisions on a daily basis

* if you have a coach who talks to each team member on a sports team 1:1 about the game play without anyone knowing what everyone else was talking about, that's not a team; that's a collection of individuals

* we are all responsible for each others' functionalities and the indicators of team success

* when people don't feel like part of the group, they often act like consultants and use words like "you" instead of "we/us"

* it's better to overstate the problem than to understate it

* __politics:__ when people choose their words and actions based on how they want others to react, rather than based on what they really think

* __Dysfunction #2: Fear of conflict__
    - when you don't trust each other, you don't engage in open, constructive, ideological conflict; you just preserve a sense of artificial harmony
        * must differentiate between tension and constructive conflict
    - harmony is good if it's a result from a cycle of working through issues constantly and cycling through conflict
    - frustration sometimes surfaces in the form of subtle comments
    - evidence: artificial harmony

* __Dysfunction #3: Lack of commitment__
    - not getting clear buy-in into decisions
        * people won't get onboard if they don't unload their opinions and feel like they've been listened to
    - evidence: ambiguity

* __Dysfunction #4: Avoidance of accountability__
    - once you achieve clarity & buy-in, need to hold each other accountable (even if it means interpersonal discomfort)
        * people won't hold each other accountable if they haven't bought in to the same plan
    - evidence: low standards

## Part 3: Heavy lifting

* tolerance of the behavior is what hurts the group's production

## The model

* Involves/indicators:
    - calling out one another's deficiencies or unproductive behaviors
    - know what their peers are working on and how they contribute to the collective good of the team
    - genuinely apologizing when doing/saying something inappropriate/damaging to the team
    - willingly make sacrifices in their department/areas of expertise for the good of the team
    - openly admitting weaknesses and mistakes
    - team meetings are compelling & not boring
    - morale is significantly affected by failure to achieve team goals
    - during meetings, the most important/difficult issues are put on the table to be resolved
    - team members know about one another's personal lives and are comfortable discussing them (hmmm)
    - team members challenge each other about their plans and approaches
    - team members are slow to seek credit for their own contributions, but quick to point out those of others

### Understanding and overcoming the five dysfunctions

#### Dysfunction 1: Absence of trust

* __trust:__ confidence amongst team members that their peers' intentions are good, and that there's no reason to be protective/careful around the group
    - should be able ot focus their energy & attention completely on the job at hand, rather than on being strategically disingenuous/political with each other

* how to build trust:
    - shared experiences overtime
    - multiple of instances of follow-through and credibility
    - an in-depth understanding of the unique attributes of team members
    - exercises
        * team effectiveness exercise:
            1. team members identify the single most important contribution that each of their peers makes to the team, and also another area that they must either improve upon or eliminate for the good of the team
            2. all members report their responses, usually starting with the team lead
        * 360-degree feedback
            - best way to make it work is to far-remove it from compensation and formal performance evaluation

#### Dysfunction 2: Fear of conflict

* distinguish productive ideological conflict from destructive fighting & interpersonal politics

* healthy conflict actually saves time because you don't need to revisit the issue time and time again without resolution

#### Dysfunction 3: Lack of commitment

* people don't need to reach consensus to achieve buy-in, but they do need to have their ideas have been heard and actually considered

* people don't need absolute certainty, because a decision is better than no decision because of trying to reach 100% certainty
    - this allows them to build the skill of learning from mistakes

* ways to introduce commitment:
    - reviewing key decisions at the end of meetings
    - clear deadlines for when decisions are made
    - conducting contingency and worst-case scenario analysis
    - experimenting with decisiveness in low-risk situations

#### Dysfunction 4: Avoidance of accountability

* this dysfunction:
    - causes relationships to deteriorate anyway, because team members begin to resent one another for not living up to expectations, and for allowing the group's standards to erode
        * why? because people have different standards of performance
    - encourages mediocrity
    - leads to missed deadlines and key deliverables
    - places an undue burden on the team leader as the sole source of discipline

* accountability:
    - ensures that poor performers feel pressure to improve

* how to increase accountability:
    - publication of goals and standards
    - simple and regular progress reviews
    - team rewards

#### Dysfunction 5: Inattention to results

* a team that isn't focused on results:
    - loses achievement-oriented employees
    - encourages members to focus on their own careers and individual goals
    - is easily distracted

* ways to increase attention to results:
    - public declaration of results
    - results-based rewards
