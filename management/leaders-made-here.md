# Leaders Made Here: Building a Leadership Culture

> How do you ensure you'll have the needed leaders to fuel your future success?

> A leadership culture exists when leaders are routinely and systematically developed, _and_ you have a surplus of leaders ready for the next opportunity or challenge.

### Human error

* leaders are responsible for the culture in an organization

* leadership bench - concept of having replacements for the current leadership, often at least 3-person deep

### Bet on leadership

Of course, the best quote that humanity has to offer:

> "Hope is not a strategy."

* Four moves that enable high performance:
    1. Bet on leadership
    2. Act as one
    3. Win the hearts
    4. Excel at execution

### The assignment

> Culture is the sum of people's habits. It's not what you want it to be, it's what people do on a regular basis. So, if you routinely and systematically develop leaders, then it's part of your culture.

### Our point of view

> If you can create a culture in which growing leaders is part of your DNA, you can always position yourself to win.

* key deliverables in creating a leadership culture:
    - identify the systems, practices, mechanisms, and activities that'll enable us to create a leadership culture, and define a preliminary budget required to begin the journey

* design principles in creating a leadership culture:
    - creating a process/framework/strategy that applies to leaders at all levels
    - clearly communicate that individual leaders must take responsibility for their own development
    - plan for a highly customized process
    - determine ways to intentionally engage emerging leaders in the process
    - solicit input from across the organization during the development phases of this project
    - incorporate global best practices (!!! so important)

> leadership is an iceberg; about 10% above the waterline is skills (doing), and 90% below the iceberg is character (being)

* SERVE acronym:
    - __S__ee the future
    - __E__ngage and develop others
    - __R__einvent continuously
    - __V__alue results and relationships
    - __E__mbody the values

### That's my job

* action items in creating a leadership development plan/program:
    * talk to key stakeholders in the company about leadership development
    * find secondary research on companies that excel at developing leaders
    * compile a list of current activities underway in the arena of leadership development across the organization
    * create a short list of companies that'd be willing to host a benchmark visit from the team

* interview questions to discover what worked for leadership development
    - what contributed to your growth as a leader?
    - what characteristics do you look for when attempting to identify emerging leaders?
    - which activities do you generally find most helpful in fostering the growth of an emerging leader?
    - how do you monitor the growth of leaders on your team?

### Study the best

* benchmarking 6-8 other companies who have done really well at creating a leadership culture and having prolonged outstanding performance

### Scale matters

* there's real power in a common definition of leadership, but there's even more power in a common leadership skillset

### The big idea

* employment brand
    - brand: what you want people to think about when they hear the name
        * a brand is like a promise
        * e.g. growth and development opportunities for employees

> most people do want to grow; sometimes they need a little encouragement to combat complacency

> hold strategies tightly and tactics loosely
