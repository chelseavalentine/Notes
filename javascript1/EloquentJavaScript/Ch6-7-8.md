# Chapter 6: The Secret Life of Objects

### History

* _encapsulation_: distinguishing between internal complexity and external interface
    - in other words, you can use something w/o knowing every detail about it, or how functions work exactly


### Methods

* __method__: a property that holds a function value

```javascript
var rabbit = { descriptor: "pink"};
rabbit.speak = function(words) {
    console.log("The", this.descriptor, "rabbit says, '" + line + "'");
}

rabbit.speak("Yo."); // The pink rabbit says, 'Yo.'
```
* `.apply()` calls the function it's a method of, but takes its arguments normally, rather than as an array


```javascript
speak.apply(pink, ["Hi. I am pink."]);
// or
speak.apply({descriptor: "pink"}, "Hi. I am pink, too.");
```


### Prototypes

* __prototype__: another object that's used as a fall-back source of properties
    - `Object.getPrototypeOf([Object])` gives you the object's prototype

You can create new objects, too. Kind of like how you can create new HTML elements

```javascript
var protoRabbit = {
    speak: function (line) {
        console.log("The", this.type, "rabbit says, '" + line + "'");
    }
};

var bunny = Object.create(protoRabbit);
bunny.type = "little rabbit";
bunny.speak("Yo yo.");
```


### Constructors

* `new` creates a new instance of a constructor that's specified after new

```javascript
function Rabbit(type) {
    this.type = type;
}


var bunny = new Rabbit("bunny");
```


Constructors all have the `prototype` property, so we can have instances of a constructor all share a method by doing something like this:

```javascript
Rabbit.prototype.speak = function(line) { 
    console.log(this.type, "rabbit says, 'I'm tired of speaking already. Gosh.", line + "'");
};

bunny.speak("Can I go home now?");
```

* constructors are functions
* You can override properties that exist in functions by just reassigning it for a particular object


### Prototype interference

* JS distinguishes between enumerable & non-enumerable properties
    - enumerable: properties we create by assigning them
    - non-enumerable: standard properties in Object.prototype

You can define non-enumerable properties with `Object.defineProperty`.

```javascript
Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, "boo", {enumerable: false, value: "wut"});

for (var x in [Object]) {
    console.log(x); // All properties except the non-enumerable ones will be listed
}
```

* `Object.hasOwnProperty(["propertyName"])` tells you whether an object has a property, _without looking at its prototypes_


### Prototype-less objects

* You can pass `null` as a prototype to create an object w/o any prototypes

```javascript
var bunny = Object.create(null);
bunny["cow"] = "what is going on";
console.log("toString" in bunny); // false
console.log("cow" in bunny); //true
```


### Polymorphism

* __polymorphism__: being able to add/override members, even after an object has been created. So objects can acquire/lose properties and behaviors over time


### Getters and setters

```javascript
var pile = {
    elements: ["ugh", "why", "what"],
    get height() {
        return this.elements.length;
    },
    set height(value) {
        console.log("lol you wish you could set the height value to", value);
    }
};

console.log(pile.height); // 3
pile.height = 100; // lol you wish you could set the height value to 100
```

* `Object.defineProperty()` can be used to create getters and setters, too
    - When a getter, but no setter, is written, writing to the property is ignored

```javascript
Object.defineProperty(TextCell.prototype, "heightProp", {
    get: function() {
        return this.text.length;
    }
});
var cell = new TextCell("I'm\nHungry.");
console.log(cell.heightProp); // 2
```


### Inheritance

* __inheritance__: basing a new constructor on an old one; you can let the new constructor inherit the old constructor's properties and methods

In this example, RTextCell inherits methods and properties from TextCell, and changes the draw method

```javascript
function RTextCell(text) {
    TextCell.call(this, text);
}

RTextCell.prototype = Object.create(TextCell.prototype);
RTextCell.prototype.draw = function(width, height) {
    var result = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < height; i++) {
        var line = this.text[i] || "";
        result.push(repeat(" ", width - line.length) + line);
    }

    return result;
};
```


### The `instanceof` operator

Can use `instanceof` with objects to verify which constructor it belongs to

```javascript
console.log(new Duckie("Yo yo duck") instanceof Duckie); // true
console.log(new RTextCell("A") instanceof TextCell); // true
console.log(new TextCell("A") instanceof RTextCell); // false
console.log([1] instanceof Array); // true
```



# Chapter 7: Project: Electronic Life

* each function call gets its own `this` binding, so the `this` of an inner function doesn't refer to the `this` of the outer function
    - You can work around it by assigning the outer `this` to a variable and passing it to the inner function



# Chapter 8: Bugs and Error Handling


### Strict mode

* JavaScript is quite lax. You can make it be more like Java by typing `"use strict"` at the top of a file or function

```javascript
function spotIssues() {
    "use strict";
    for (counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++)
        console.log("Yes");
}

spotIssues(); // ReferenceError: counter is not defined
```

_usually, when you use a variable w/o defining it with `var`, JS will create a global variable and use that_

* Strict mode doesn't allow you to give a function multiple parameters w/ the same name
    - it can also get rid of a lot of problematic language features


### Testing

Example:

```javascript
function testVector() {
    var p1 = new Vector(10, 20);
    var p2 = new Vector(-10, 5);
    var p3 = p1.plus(p2);

    if (p1.x !== 10) return "fail: x property";
    if (p1.y !== 20) return "fail: y property"; 
    // ... etc.
    return "Everything works.";
}

console.log(testVector()); // Everything works.
```


### Exceptions

* Exception handling lets you throw an exception when bad input is given to a function
    - __unwinding the stack__: when an exception is thrown, it'll jump back through all of the callers that called the function in which the exception was thrown 

```javascript
function promptDirection(question) {
    var result = prompt(question, "");
    if (result.toLowerCase() == "left") return "L";
    if (result.toLowerCase() == "right") return "R";
    throw new Error ("Invalid direction:", result);
}

function look() {
    if (promptDirection("Which way?") == "L")
        return "a duck";
    else
        return "a cow";
}

try {
    console.log("You see", look());
} catch (error) {
    console.log("Something went wrong:", error);
}
```

* After the `catch` block finishes, or if the `try` block successfully executes, the control proceeds beneath the entire try/catch statement


### Cleaning up after exceptions

Even if body() throws an exception, there'll be code that's run

* `finally {}` even if everything goes to crap, run this code.

```javascript
function withContext(newContext, body) {
    var oldContext = context;
    context = newContext;
    try {
        return body();
    } finally {
        context = oldContext();
    }
}
```


### Selective catching

* `for (;;)` creates a loop that doesn't end on its own. You need to put in a `break` statement somewhere.


### Assertions

```javascript
function AssertionFailed(message) {
    this.message = message;
}

AssertionFailed.prototype = Object.create(Error.prototype);

function assert(test, message) {
    if (!test)
        throw new AssertionFailed(message);
}

function lastElement(array) {
    assert(array.length > 0, "empty array in lastElement");
    return array[array.length - 1];
}
```
