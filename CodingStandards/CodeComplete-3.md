# Code Complete

## Chapter 13: Unusual data types

### Structures

* use structures to simplify operations on blocks of data, and to simplify parameter lists

* use structures to reduce maintenance

### Pointers

* isolate pointer operations in routines or classes

* declare and define pointers at the same time

* delete pointers at the same scoping level as they were allocated

* check pointers before using them (eg. check that a data pointer is between start & end data)

* tag a field in a structure solely for the purpose of error checking, to ensure that the data hasn't been corrupted

* use extra pointer variables for clarity

* set pointers to null after deleting/freeing them, so you get an error if you try to use it

## Chapter 14: Organizing straight-line code

* organize code so that dependencies are obvious (eg. write an initializing routine)

* use routine params to make dependencies obvious (eg. all of the routines take the same param)

* document unclear dependencies with comments

* check for dependencies with assertions or error-handling code
