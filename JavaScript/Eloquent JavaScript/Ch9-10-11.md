# Chapter 9: Regular Expressions


### Creating a regular expression

__regular expression__ is a type of object created as follows:

```javascript
var re1 = new RegExp("abc"); // here, the usual rules apply for ba]ckslashes; they're ignored unless part of a special character code like \n
// or
var re2 = /abc/; // here, you need to put a backslash before any forward slash that you want to be a part of the pattern, eg. /\//
```

Some characters have special meanings in RegEx, so you need to put a backslash before them if you want them to take on their character

```javascript
var eighteenPlus = /eighteen\+/;
```


### Testing for matches

* `.test()` will tell you whether the string contains a match of the pattern in the expression

```javascript
console.log(/abc/.test("abcde")); // true
```


### Matching a set of characters

If we want to match any number, we can test whether the string contains any of the numbers within the brackets, like so:

```javascript
console.log(/[0123456789]/.test("in 1992")); // true
// or
console.log(/[0-9]/.test("in 1992")); // true
// or
console.log(/\d/.test("in 1992")); // true
```

Here, the `-` covers the range of unicode characters between those two characters. Of course, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] are next to each other.

##### Common character groups

* `\d` Any digit character
* `\w` Any alphanumeric character ("word character")
* `\s` Any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, and similar)
* `\D` Any character that is _not_ a digit
* `\W` Any nonalphanumeric character
* `\S` A nonwhitespace character
* `.` Any character except for newline

These can be used between backslashes or square brackets

```javascript
/[\d.]/ // any digit or period character
```

##### Inverting a selection

To invert a set of characters (get any characters _except_ the ones in the set), use a `^` character after the opening bracket.

```javascript
var notBinary = /[^01]/;
console.log(notBinary.test(110010)); // false
console.log(notBinary.test(101020)); // true
```


### Repeating parts of a pattern

* Using a `+` sign after an element in a regular expression, it says the element can be repeated more than once.
    - Eg. (`/\d+/` matches one or more digit characters.)
* Using a `*` allows the pattern to match 0 times
    - doesn't prevent a pattern from repeating, it just matches 0 instances if it can't find a text match

```javascript
console.log(/'\d+'/.test("'123'")); // true
console.log(/'\d+'/.test("''")); // false
console.log(/\d*/.test("'123'")); // true
console.log(/'\d*'/.test("''")); // true
```

* Using a `?` says the pattern match is optional. So it can occur 0 or 1 time.

```javascript
var neighbor = /neighbou?r/;
console.log(neighbor.test("neighbour")); // true
console.log(neighbor.test("neighbor")); // true
```
