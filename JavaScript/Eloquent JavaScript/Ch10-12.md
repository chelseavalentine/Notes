# Chapter 10: Modules

### Why modules help

##### Namespacing

* JS doesn't give you as much control as Java, when it comes to controlling visibility
    - everything that needs to be visible outside of the scope of a top-level function is visible everywhere
        + you can use objects to make publicly accessible subnamespaces
        + functions can be used to create isolated, private namespaces in a module


### Require

* the `require` function allows you to load a JS module into the file
    - it's built into Node.js, but not regular JS for the browser


### Slow-loading modules

* You can Browserify your code prior to loading it on a webpage

##### Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) module system

* wrap code in a function so the module loader loads its dependencies in the background, and then calls the function to initialiez the module when the dependencies are loaded

eg. this. It's a part of a larger program, where functions like 'define' are already written
```javascript
define(["weekday", "today"], function(weekDay, today) {
    console.log(weekDay.name(today.dayNumber()));
    }); 
```
