# Chapter 10: Modules

### Why modules help

##### Namespacing

* JS doesn't give you as much control as Java, when it comes to controlling visibility
    - everything that needs to be visible outside of the scope of a top-level function is visible everywhere
        + you can use objects to make publicly accessible subnamespaces
        + functions can be used to create isolated, private namespaces in a module


### Require

* the `require` function allows you to load a JS module into the file
    - it's built into Node.js, but not regular JS for the browser


### Slow-loading modules

* You can Browserify your code prior to loading it on a webpage

##### Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) module system

* wrap code in a function so the module loader loads its dependencies in the background, and then calls the function to initialiez the module when the dependencies are loaded

eg. this. It's a part of a larger program, where functions like 'define' are already written
```javascript
define(["weekday", "today"], function(weekDay, today) {
    console.log(weekDay.name(today.dayNumber()));
    }); 
```

### Networks and the Internet

* __TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection__
    - a computer waits/listens for other computers to talk to it
        + the _port_ is the listener
    - __server__: the listening computer
    - __client__: the connecting computer 

### The Web

* __HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)__ allows computers to request documents over the network
    - each document is named by a UniversalResourceLocator
    - eg. in http://google.com/design, http:// is the protocol, google.com is the server, and design is the path

* __sandboxing__: allowing enough free reign for a program to be useful, while also restricting it from doing anything harmful (eg. hacking your computer)
